**Realtime API support is coming soon!** Join our [Discord community](https://portkey.sh/discord) to be the first to know when LiveKit's realtime model integration with Portkey is available.
</Note>

LiveKit is a powerful platform for building real-time voice and video applications. When combined with Portkey, you get enterprise-grade features that make your LiveKit voice agents production-ready:

- **Unified AI Gateway** - Single interface for 250+ LLMs with API key management
- **Centralized AI observability**: Real-time usage tracking for 40+ key metrics and logs for every request
- **Governance** - Real-time spend tracking, set budget limits and RBAC in your LiveKit agents
- **Security Guardrails** - PII detection, content filtering, and compliance controls

This guide will walk you through integrating Portkey with LiveKit's STT-LLM-TTS pipeline to build enterprise-ready voice AI agents.

<Note>
  If you are an enterprise looking to deploy LiveKit agents in production, [check out this section](#3-set-up-enterprise-governance-for-livekit).

# 1. Setting up Portkey
Portkey allows you to use 250+ LLMs with your LiveKit agents, with minimal configuration required. Let's set up the core components in Portkey that you'll need for integration.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Virtual Key">
Virtual Keys are Portkey's secure way to manage your LLM provider API keys. For LiveKit integration, you'll need to create a virtual key for OpenAI (or any other LLM provider you prefer).

To create a virtual key:
1. Go to [Virtual Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/virtual-keys) in the Portkey App
2. Click "Add Virtual Key" and select OpenAI as the provider
3. Add your OpenAI API key
4. Save and copy the virtual key ID

</Frame>

<Note>
Save your virtual key ID - you'll need it for the next step.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Create Default Config">

Configs in Portkey define how your requests are routed and can enable features like fallbacks, caching, and more.

To create your config:
1. Go to [Configs](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new config with:
    ```json
    {
        "virtual_key": "YOUR_VIRTUAL_KEY_FROM_STEP1"
    }
    ```
3. Save and note the Config ID for the next step

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/config.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
This basic config connects to your virtual key. You can add advanced features like caching, fallbacks, and guardrails later.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Portkey API Key">

Now create a Portkey API key and attach the config you created:

1. Go to [API Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys) in Portkey
2. Create new API key
3. Select your config from Step 2
4. Generate and save your API key

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/api-key.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
Save your API key securely - you'll need it for LiveKit integration.
</Note>
</Step>
</Steps>

# 2. Integrate Portkey with LiveKit

Now that you have your Portkey components set up, let's integrate them with LiveKit agents.

## Installation

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install \
  "livekit-agents[openai]~=1.0"
```

## Configuration

```python
llm=openai.LLM(model="gpt-4o", # your preferred model
               api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY", # you can also set OPENAI_API_KEY=<Your Portkey API key> in .env
               base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1", # Portkey Base Url
               ),
```

<Warning>
Make sure your Portkey virtual key has sufficient budget and rate limits for your expected usage.
</Warning>




## End-to-End Example using Portkey and LiveKit
Build a simple voice assistant with Python in less than 10 minutes.


<Steps>

  <Step title="Setup">

# 3. Set Up Enterprise Governance for Livekit

**Why Enterprise Governance?**
If you are using Livekit inside your orgnaization, you need to consider several governance aspects:
- **Cost Management**: Controlling and tracking AI spending across teams
- **Access Control**: Managing which teams can use specific models
- **Usage Analytics**: Understanding how AI is being used across the organization
- **Security & Compliance**: Maintaining enterprise security standards
- **Reliability**: Ensuring consistent service across all users

Portkey adds a comprehensive governance layer to address these enterprise needs. Let's implement these controls step by step.

**Enterprise Implementation Guide**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits">
### Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits

Virtual Keys enable granular control over LLM access at the team/department level. This helps you:
- Set up [budget limits](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys/budget-limits)
- Prevent unexpected usage spikes using Rate limits
- Track departmental spending

#### Setting Up Department-Specific Controls:
1. Navigate to [Virtual Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/virtual-keys) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new Virtual Key for each department with budget limits and rate limits
3. Configure department-specific limits

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/openai/virtual-key-2.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 2: Define Model Access Rules">
### Step 2: Define Model Access Rules

As your AI usage scales, controlling which teams can access specific models becomes crucial. Portkey Configs provide this control layer with features like:

#### Access Control Features:
- **Model Restrictions**: Limit access to specific models
- **Data Protection**: Implement guardrails for sensitive data
- **Reliability Controls**: Add fallbacks and retry logic

#### Example Configuration:
Here's a basic configuration to route requests to OpenAI, specifically using GPT-4o:

```json
{
	"strategy": {
		"mode": "single"
	},
	"targets": [
		{
			"virtual_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_VIRTUAL_KEY",
			"override_params": {
				"model": "gpt-4o"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

Create your config on the [Configs page](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in your Portkey dashboard. You'll need the config ID for connecting to Livekit's setup.


<Note>
Configs can be updated anytime to adjust controls without affecting running applications.
</Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 3: Implement Access Controls">
### Step 3: Implement Access Controls

Create User-specific API keys that automatically:
- Track usage per user/team with the help of virtual keys
- Apply appropriate configs to route requests
- Collect relevant metadata to filter logs
- Enforce access permissions


Create API keys through:
- [Portkey App](https://app.portkey.ai/)
- [API Key Management API](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key)


Example using Python SDK:
```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(api_key="YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY")

api_key = portkey.api_keys.create(
    name="engineering-team",
    type="organisation",
    workspace_id="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID",
    defaults={
        "config_id": "your-config-id",
        "metadata": {
            "environment": "production",
            "department": "engineering"
        }
    },
    scopes=["logs.view", "configs.read"]
)
```

For detailed key management instructions, see our [API Keys documentation](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 4: Deploy & Monitor">
### Step 4: Deploy & Monitor
After distributing API keys to your team members, your enterprise-ready Livekit setup is ready to go. Each team member can now use their designated API keys with appropriate access levels and budget controls.
Apply your governance setup using the integration steps from earlier sections

### 3. Unified Access to 1600+ LLMs

You can easily switch between 1600+ LLMs. Call various LLMs such as Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral, Azure OpenAI, Google Vertex AI, AWS Bedrock, and many more by simply changing the `virtual key` in your default `config` object.


### 4. Advanced Metadata Tracking
Using Portkey, you can add custom metadata to your LLM requests for detailed tracking and analytics. Use metadata tags to filter logs, track usage, and attribute costs across departments and teams.
