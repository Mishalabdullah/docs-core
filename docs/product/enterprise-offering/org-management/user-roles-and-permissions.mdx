## User Roles and Permissions

Portkey implements a hierarchical role-based access control system to manage permissions at both the [organization](/docs/product/enterprise-offering/org-management/organizations) and [workspace](/docs/portkey-endpoints/admin/workspaces) levels. This system ensures that users have appropriate access to resources based on their responsibilities.

### Organization Level

At the organization level, there are two primary roles:

1. **Owner**
   * Has full control over the organization
   * Can manage all aspects of the organization, including creating and deleting workspaces
   * Can assign and revoke org admin roles
2. **Org Admin**
   * Has administrative access to all workspaces within the organization
   * Can create new workspaces
   * Can manage admin API keys
   * Has the ability to invite users to the organization

### Workspace Level

Within each workspace, there are two roles:

1. **Manager**
   * Has administrative control within the workspace
   * Can add and remove team members
   * Can create and manage workspace API keys
   * Has access to all workspace features and data
2. **Member**
   * Has standard access to workspace resources
   * Can use workspace features as permitted by the manager
   * Cannot add or remove team members or manage API keys
