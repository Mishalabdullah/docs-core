Portkey provides a robust and secure gateway to facilitate the integration of various models into your applications, including [Jina AI embedding & reranker models](https://jina.ai/).

With Portkey, you can take advantage of features like fast AI gateway access, observability, and more, all while ensuring the secure management of your API keys through a [virtual key](/docs/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys) system.

## Portkey SDK Integration with Jina AI Models

Portkey provides a consistent API to interact with models from various providers. To integrate Jina AI with Portkey:

### 1\. Install the Portkey SDK

Add the Portkey SDK to your application to interact with Jina AI's API through Portkey's gateway.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NodeJS">

    ```
    npm install --save portkey-ai
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">

```
pip install portkey-ai
```
  </Tab>

</Tabs>



### 2\. Initialize Portkey with the Virtual Key

To use JinaAI with Portkey, [get your API key from here](https://jina.ai/), then add it to Portkey to create the virtual key.
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
    ```
    import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'


    const portkey = new Portkey({

        apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY", // defaults to process.env["PORTKEY_API_KEY"]

        virtualKey: "JINA_AI_VIRTUAL_KEY" // Your Jina AI Virtual Key

    })
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python SDK">
    ```
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(

    api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",  # Replace with your Portkey API key

    virtual_key="JINA_AI_VIRTUAL_KEY"   # Replace with your virtual key for Jina AI

)
```
  </Tab>

</Tabs>




### **3\. Invoke Embeddings with** Jina AI

Use the Portkey instance to send your embeddings requests to Jina AI. You can also override the virtual key directly in the API call if needed.
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
    ```
    const embeddings = await portkey.embeddings.create({

        input: "embed this",

        model: "jina-embeddings-v2-base-es",

    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python SDK">
    ```
embeddings = portkey.embeddings.create(

    input='embed this',

    model='jina-embeddings-v2-base-de'

)
```
  </Tab>

</Tabs>

### Using Jina AI Reranker Models

Portkey also supports the Reranker models by Jina AI through the REST API.
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="REST API">
    ```
    curl https://api.portkey.ai/v1/rerank \

      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

      -H "Authorization: Bearer $JINA_AI_API_KEY" \

      -H "x-portkey-provider: jina" \

      -d '{

      "model": "jina-reranker-v1-base-en",

      "query": "Organic skincare products for sensitive skin",

      "documents": [

        "Eco-friendly kitchenware for modern homes",

        "Biodegradable cleaning supplies for eco-conscious consumers",

        "Organic cotton baby clothes for sensitive skin"

      ],

      "top_n": 2

    }'

    ```
  </Tab>

</Tabs>
