## Overview

Portkey offers powerful control mechanisms for organization and workspace API keys through budget limits, rate limits, and email notifications. These features help enterprises monitor, manage, and optimize their AI usage while maintaining cost control and performance.

Unlike virtual key limits which apply to provider-specific resources, API key limits apply at the Portkey platform level, giving you governance across your entire organization or specific workspaces.

## Budget Limits for API Keys

Budget limits enable you to set spending thresholds on API keys, automatically preventing further usage when limits are reached.

### Setting Budget Limits

When creating or editing an API key, you can enable budget limits by:

1. Toggling on **Add Budget Limit**
2. Selecting a limit type:
   - **Cost**: Limit based on dollar amount (minimum $1)
   - **Tokens**: Limit based on token consumption

### Alert Thresholds

Set notification thresholds to receive alerts before reaching your full budget:

1. Enter an amount in the **Alert Threshold** field
2. The system will automatically notify designated recipients when this threshold is crossed
3. The API key remains active until the full budget limit is reached

### Periodic Reset Options

Budget limits can be configured to reset automatically:

- **No Periodic Reset**: Budget applies until exhausted
- **Reset Weekly**: Resets every Sunday at 12 AM UTC
- **Reset Monthly**: Resets on the 1st day of each month at 12 AM UTC

## Rate Limits for API Keys

Rate limits allow you to control the velocity of API requests or token consumption, helping maintain application performance and prevent abuse.

### Setting Rate Limits

When creating or editing an API key, you can enable rate limits by:

1. Toggling on **Add Rate Limit**
2. Selecting a limit type:
   - **Requests**: Limit based on number of API calls
   - **Tokens**: Limit based on token consumption
3. Specifying the limit value and time interval

</Frame>

### Rate Limit Intervals

Choose from three time intervals:
- **Per Minute**: For strict, granular control
- **Per Hour**: For balanced usage control
- **Per Day**: For broader usage patterns

### Exceeding Rate Limits

When a rate limit is reached:
- Subsequent requests are rejected with a 429 (Too Many Requests) error
- The API key resumes accepting requests after the time interval resets

## Email Notifications

Configure email notifications to keep stakeholders informed about API key usage and limits.

### Setting Up Email Notifications

When creating or editing an API key with budget limits:

1. Toggle on **Email Notifications**
2. Add recipient email addresses:
   - Enter an email address in the input field
   - Click **New** or press Enter to add additional recipients
   - Click the **X** next to an email to remove it

</Frame>

### Default Recipients

By default, notifications are automatically sent to:
- Organization admins
- Organization owners
- The API key creator/owner

### Additional Recipients

You can add additional recipients who need visibility into API usage:
- Finance teams
- Department heads
- Project managers
- DevOps teams
- Other stakeholders

### Notification Triggers

Email alerts are sent when:
- Usage reaches the specified alert threshold
- The budget limit is reached
- The API key is automatically disabled due to reaching the limit

## Organization vs. Workspace API Keys

### Organization API Keys

- Apply across all workspaces within an organization
- Can only be created by organization owners and admins
- Provide broader access and management capabilities
- Budget and rate limits apply organization-wide

### Workspace API Keys

- Scoped to a specific workspace
- Can be created by workspace managers
- Limited to operations within the workspace
- Budget and rate limits apply only to the specific workspace

## Key Considerations

- Limits are applied immediately after being set
- Once set, limits cannot be edited (create a new key if changes are needed)
- Setting a rate limit to 0 effectively disables the API key
- Budget limits apply only to requests made after the limit is set
- Limits work for all providers available through Portkey

## Monitoring Usage and Limits

Track your API key usage in real-time through:

1. The **Analytics** tab in your Portkey dashboard
2. Filtering by specific API keys and timeframes
3. Viewing detailed logs showing request patterns and cost information
