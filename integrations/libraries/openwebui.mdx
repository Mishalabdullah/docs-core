This guide will help you implement enterprise-grade security, observability, and governance for OpenWebUI using Portkey. While OpenWebUI supports various provider plugins, Portkey provides a unified interface for all your LLM providers, offering comprehensive features for model management, cost tracking, observability, and metadata logging.

For IT administrators deploying centralized instances of OpenWebUI, Portkey enables essential enterprise features including usage tracking, access controls, and budget management. Let's walk through implementing these features step by step.

# Understanding the Implementation
When implementing Portkey with OpenWebUI in your organization, we'll follow these key steps:

1. Basic OpenWebUI integration with Portkey
2. Setting up organizational governance using Virtual Keys and Configs
3. Managing user access and permissions

<Note>
If you're an individual user just looking to use Portkey with OpenWebUI, you only need to complete Steps 1 and 2 to get started.
</Note>

## 1. Basic Integration

Let's start by integrating Portkey with your OpenWebUI installation. This integration uses OpenWebUI's pipeline functionality to route all requests through Portkey's Platform.

**Installing the Portkey Plugin**
1. Start your OpenWebUI server
2. Navigate to `Workspace` and then go to the `Functions` section
3. Click on the `+` button in UI
4. Copy and paste the [Portkey plugin](https://openwebui.com/f/nath/portkey/) code

</Frame>

## 2. Setting Up Portkey Pipeline

To use OpenWebUI with Portkey, you'll need to configure three key components:

**Portkey API Key**:
Get your Portkey API key from [here](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys). You'll need this for authentication with Portkey's services.

**Virtual Keys**:
Virtual Keys are Portkey's secure way to manage your LLM provider API keys. They provide essential controls like:
- Budget limits for API usage
- Rate limiting capabilities
- Secure API key storage


Craeate a [Virtual Key](https://app.portkey.ai/virtual-keys) in your Portkey dashboard and save it for future use.

For detailed information on budget limits, [refer to this documentation](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys/budget-limits)

**Using Configs (Optional)**:
Configs in Portkey enhance your implementation with features like advanced routing, fallbacks, and retries. Here's a simple config example that implements 5 retry attempts on server errors:

```json
{
    "retry": {
        "attempts": 5
    },
    "virtual_key": "virtual-key-xxx"
}
```
You can create and store these configs in Portkey's config library. This can later be accessed on using the Config Slug in Open WebUI.

Configs are highly flexible and can be customized for various use cases. Learn more in our [Configs documentation](https://docs.portkey.ai/configs).


## 3. Configure Pipeline Variables

The pipeline setup involves configuring both credentials and model access in OpenWebUI.

**Credentials Setup**:
1. In OpenWebUI, navigate to `Workspace` â†’ `Functions`
2. Click the `Valves` button to open the configuration interface
3. Add the following credentials:
   - Your Portkey API Key
   - Config slug (if using Configs)
   - Base URL (only needed for Open Source Gateway users)

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/openwebui.png" width="600" />
</Frame>

**Model Configuration**
1. In the Functions section, click the `...` button and select `Edit`
2. Find the virtual keys JSON object in the Portkey function code
3. Update it with your virtual keys:
   ```json
   "virtual_keys": {
       "openai": "YOUR_OPENAI_VIRTUAL_KEY",
       "anthropic": "YOUR_ANTHROPIC_VIRTUAL_KEY"
   }
   ```
4. Configure model names in the pipe function in this format:
   ```json
    {
        "id": "provider_slug_from_portkey/model_id_from_provider", // syntax for ID
        "name": "provider_slug_from_portkey/model_id_from_provider", // for easier navigation
    }

   ```
   Example:
```json
    {
        "id": "openai/gpt-4o",
        "name": "openai/gpt-4o",
    }
 ```

   <Note> Make sure you use the correct provider slug from Portke docs. Ex: `perplexity-ai` is correct. `perplexity` is wrong</Note>
5. Save your changes



# 4. Set Up Enterprise Governance for OpenWebUI

**Why Enterprise Governance?**
If you are using OpenWeb UI inside your orgnaization, you need to consider several governance aspects:
- **Cost Management**: Controlling and tracking AI spending across teams
- **Access Control**: Managing which teams can use specific models
- **Usage Analytics**: Understanding how AI is being used across the organization
- **Security & Compliance**: Maintaining enterprise security standards
- **Reliability**: Ensuring consistent service across all users

Portkey adds a comprehensive governance layer to address these enterprise needs. Let's implement these controls step by step.

**Enterprise Implementation Guide**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits">
### Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits

Virtual Keys enable granular control over LLM access at the team/department level. This helps you:
- Set up [budget limits](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys/budget-limits)
- Prevent unexpected usage spikes using Rate limits
- Track departmental spending

#### Setting Up Department-Specific Controls:
1. Navigate to [Virtual Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/virtual-keys) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new Virtual Key for each department with budget limits and rate limits
3. Configure department-specific limits

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/openai/virtual-key-2.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 2: Define Model Access Rules">
### Step 2: Define Model Access Rules

As your AI usage scales, controlling which teams can access specific models becomes crucial. Portkey Configs provide this control layer with features like:

#### Access Control Features:
- **Model Restrictions**: Limit access to specific models
- **Data Protection**: Implement guardrails for sensitive data
- **Reliability Controls**: Add fallbacks and retry logic

#### Example Configuration:
Here's a basic configuration to route requests to OpenAI, specifically using GPT-4o:

```json
{
	"strategy": {
		"mode": "single"
	},
	"targets": [
		{
			"virtual_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_VIRTUAL_KEY",
			"override_params": {
				"model": "gpt-4o"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

Create your config on the [Configs page](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in your Portkey dashboard. You'll need the config ID for connecting to OpenWeb UI's setup.


<Note>
Configs can be updated anytime to adjust controls without affecting running applications.
</Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 3: Implement Access Controls">
### Step 3: Implement Access Controls

Create User-specific API keys that automatically:
- Track usage per user/team with the help of virtual keys
- Apply appropriate configs to route requests
- Collect relevant metadata to filter logs
- Enforce access permissions


Create API keys through:
- [Portkey App](https://app.portkey.ai/)
- [API Key Management API](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key)


Example using Python SDK:
```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(api_key="YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY")

api_key = portkey.api_keys.create(
    name="engineering-team",
    type="organisation",
    workspace_id="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID",
    defaults={
        "config_id": "your-config-id",
        "metadata": {
            "environment": "production",
            "department": "engineering"
        }
    },
    scopes=["logs.view", "configs.read"]
)
```
