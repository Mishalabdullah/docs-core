Portkey provides a robust and secure gateway to facilitate the integration of various Large Language Models (LLMs) into your applications, including your **locally hosted models through Ollama**.
<Note>
Provider Slug. **`ollama`**

## Portkey SDK Integration with Ollama Models

Portkey provides a consistent API to interact with models from various providers. To integrate Ollama with Portkey:

### 1\. Install the Portkey SDK

Install the Portkey SDK in your application to interact with your Ollama API through Portkey.
<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS">

```sh
npm install --save portkey-ai
```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python">
        ```sh
        pip install portkey-ai
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>



### 2\. Initialize Portkey with Ollama URL

Instantiate the Portkey client by adding your Ollama publicly-exposed URL to the `customHost` property.
<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
        ```js
        import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'

        const portkey = new Portkey({
            apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY", // defaults to process.env["PORTKEY_API_KEY"]
            provider: "ollama",
            customHost: "https://7cc4-3-235-157-146.ngrok-free.app" // Your Ollama ngrok URL
        })
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">
        ```python
        from portkey_ai import Portkey

        portkey = Portkey(
            api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",  # Replace with your Portkey API key
            provider="ollama",
            custom_host="https://7cc4-3-235-157-146.ngrok-free.app" # Your Ollama ngrok URL
        )
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>


<Note>
For the Ollama integration, you only need to pass the base URL to `**customHost**` without the version identifier (such as `**/v1**`) - Portkey takes care of it for Ollama.
</Note>
<Warning>
Requests made to your localhost Ollama endpoints will fail. To integrate with Portkey and to observe your requests, you'll need to expose your localhost URLs publicly via a service like ngrok.
</Warning>
### **3\. Invoke Chat Completions with** Ollama

Use the Portkey SDK to invoke chat completions from your Ollama model, just as you would with any other provider.
<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
        ```js
        const chatCompletion = await portkey.chat.completions.create({
            messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],
            model: 'llama3',
        });

        console.log(chatCompletion.choices);
        ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">
        ```python
        completion = portkey.chat.completions.create(
            messages= [{ "role": 'user', "content": 'Say this is a test' }],
            model= 'llama3'
        )

        print(completion)
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>
