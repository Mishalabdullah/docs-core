title: "Anthropic"

Portkey provides a robust and secure gateway to facilitate the integration of various Large Language Models (LLMs) into your applications, including [Anthropic's Claude APIs](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api).

With Portkey, you can take advantage of features like fast AI gateway access, observability, prompt management, and more, all while ensuring the secure management of your LLM API keys through a [virtual key](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys) system.
<Note>Provider Slug. `anthropic`</Note>


## Portkey SDK Integration with Anthropic

Portkey provides a consistent API to interact with models from various providers. To integrate Anthropic with Portkey:

### 1\. Install the Portkey SDK

Add the Portkey SDK to your application to interact with Anthropic's API through Portkey's gateway.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS">
        ```sh
        npm install --save portkey-ai
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python">
        ```sh
        pip install portkey-ai
        ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>




### 2\. Initialize Portkey with the Virtual Key

To use Anthropic with Portkey, [get your Anthropic API key from here](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys), then add it to Portkey to create your Anthropic virtual key.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">

```js
import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'

const portkey = new Portkey({
    apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY", // defaults to process.env["PORTKEY_API_KEY"]
    virtualKey: "VIRTUAL_KEY" // Your Anthropic Virtual Key
})
```

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">

```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(
    api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",  # Replace with your Portkey API key
    virtual_key="VIRTUAL_KEY"   # Replace with your virtual key for Anthropic
)
```
    </Tab>
  <Tab title="OpenAI Python SDK">

```python
from openai import OpenAI

from portkey_ai import PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL, createHeaders

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
    base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
    default_headers=createHeaders(
        api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        provider="anthropic"
    )
)
```

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="OpenAI Node SDK">

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";

import { PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL, createHeaders } from "portkey-ai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
  baseURL: PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
  defaultHeaders: createHeaders({
    provider: "anthropic",
    apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY",
  }),
});
```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>



### 3\. Invoke Chat Completions with Anthropic

Use the Portkey instance to send requests to Anthropic. You can also override the virtual key directly in the API call if needed.


<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">

```js
const chatCompletion = await portkey.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],
    model: 'claude-3-opus-20240229',
    max_tokens: 250 // Required field for Anthropic
});

console.log(chatCompletion.choices[0].message.content);
```

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">

```python
chat_completion = portkey.chat.completions.create(
    messages= [{ "role": 'user', "content": 'Say this is a test' }],
    model= 'claude-3-opus-20240229',
    max_tokens=250 # Required field for Anthropic
)

print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

    </Tab>
  <Tab title="OpenAI Python SDK">

```python
chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages = [{ "role": 'user', "content": 'Say this is a test' }],
    model = 'claude-3-opus-20240229',
    max_tokens = 250
)

print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="OpenAI Node SDK">

```js
async function main() {
    const chatCompletion = await client.chat.completions.create({
        model: "claude-3-opus-20240229",
        max_tokens: 1024,
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello, Claude" }],
    });

    console.log(chatCompletion.choices[0].message.content);

}

main();
```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>




## How to Use Anthropic System Prompt

With Portkey, we make Anthropic models interoperable with the OpenAI schema and SDK methods. So, instead of passing the `system` prompt separately, you can pass it as part of the `messages` body, similar to OpenAI:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS">

```js
const chatCompletion = await portkey.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [
        { role: 'system', content: 'Your system prompt' },
        { role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }
    ],
    model: 'claude-3-opus-20240229',
    max_tokens: 250
});

console.log(chatCompletion.choices);
```

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python">

```python
completion = portkey.chat.completions.create(
    messages= [
        { "role": 'system', "content": 'Your system prompt' },
        { "role": 'user', "content": 'Say this is a test' }
    ],
    model= 'claude-3-opus-20240229',
    max_tokens=250 # Required field for Anthropic
)

print(completion.choices)
```

    </Tab>

  </Tabs>



## Vision Chat Completion Usage


Portkey's multimodal Gateway fully supports Anthropic's vision models `claude-3-sonnet`, `claude-3-haiku`,  `claude-3-opus`, and the latest `claude-3.5-sonnet`.
Portkey follows the OpenAI schema, which means you can send your image data to Anthropic in the same format as OpenAI.


<Note>
   - Anthropic ONLY accepts `base64` -encoded images. Unlike OpenAI, it **does not** support  `image URLs`.
- With Portkey, you can use the same format to send base64-encoded images to both Anthropic and OpenAI models.


</Note>

Here's an example using Anthropic `claude-3.5-sonnet` model

  To prompt with pdfs, simply update the "url" field inside the "image_url" object to this pattern: `data:application/pdf;base64,BASE64_PDF_DATA`
</Note>

#### [API Reference](#vision-chat-completion-usage)

On completion, the request will get logged in Portkey where any image inputs or outputs can be viewed. Portkey will automatically render the base64 images to help you debug any issues quickly.

## Prompt Caching

Portkey also works with Anthropic's new prompt caching feature and helps you save time & money for all your Anthropic requests. Refer to this guide to learn how to enable it:

<Card title="Prompt Caching" href="/integrations/llms/anthropic/prompt-caching">
</Card>


## Extended Thinking (Reasoning Models) (Beta)

<Note>
The assistants thinking response is returned in the `response.choices[0].message.content_blocks` array, not the `response.choices[0].message.content` string.
</Note>

Models like `claude-3-7-sonnet-latest` support [extended thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#streaming-extended-thinking).
This is similar to openai thinking, but you get the model's reasoning as it processes the request as well.

Note that you will have to set [`strict_open_ai_compliance=False`](/product/ai-gateway/strict-open-ai-compliance) in the headers to use this feature.

  Extended thinking API through portkey is currently in beta.

## Managing Anthropic Prompts

You can manage all prompts to Anthropic in the [Prompt Library](/product/prompt-library). All the current models of Anthropic are supported and you can easily start testing different prompts.

Once you're ready with your prompt, you can use the `portkey.prompts.completions.create` interface to use the prompt in your application.

## Next Steps

The complete list of features supported in the SDK are available on the link below.

<Card title="SDK" href="/api-reference/portkey-sdk-client">
</Card>


You'll find more information in the relevant sections:

1. [Add metadata to your requests](/product/observability/metadata)
2. [Add gateway configs to your Anthropic requests](/product/ai-gateway/configs)
3. [Tracing Anthropic requests](/product/observability/traces)
4. [Setup a fallback from OpenAI to Anthropic's Claude APIs](/product/ai-gateway/fallbacks)
