## OIDC Integration

For OIDC integration, we require the following information from your identity provider:

### Required Information

- **Issuer URL**: The URL of your identity provider's OIDC authorization endpoint. Wellknown OIDC configuration should be available at this URL.
- **Client ID**: The client ID provided by your identity provider.
- **Client Secret Key**: The client secret provided by your identity provider.

### Setup Steps
<Info>
    Following scopes are required for Portkey to work with OIDC:
    - openid
    - profile
    - email
    - offline_access

#### General
- Create an OIDC application in your identity provider.
- Once the application is created, please note the following details:
    - `Issuer URL`
    - `Client Id`
    - `Client Secret`
- Update the above details in Portkey Control Plane in `Admin Settings > Authentication Settings > OIDC`.

#### Okta
- Go to `Applications` tab on Okta dashboard and `create a new app integration`. 
- Select `OIDC - OpenID Connect` as the signin method.
