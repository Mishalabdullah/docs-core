Portkey provides a robust and secure gateway to facilitate the integration of various Large Language Models (LLMs) into your applications, including [Stability AI APIs](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference).

With Portkey, you can take advantage of features like fast AI gateway access, observability, prompt management, and more, all while ensuring the secure management of your LLM API keys through a [virtual key](/docs/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys) system.

## Portkey SDK Integration with Stability AI

Portkey provides a consistent API to interact with image generation models from various providers. To integrate Stability AI with Portkey:

### 1\. Install the Portkey SDK

Add the Portkey SDK to your application to interact with the Stability API through Portkey's gateway.
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NodeJS">
    ```
    npm install --save portkey-ai
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```
pip install portkey-ai
```
  </Tab>

</Tabs>

### 2\. Initialize Portkey with the Virtual Key

To use Stability AI with Portkey, [get your API key from here](https://platform.stability.ai/account/keys). Then add it to Portkey to create the virtual key
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
    ```js
    import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'


    const portkey = new Portkey({

        apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY", // defaults to process.env["PORTKEY_API_KEY"]

        virtualKey: "VIRTUAL_KEY" // Your Stability AI Virtual Key

    })
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python SDK">
    ```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(

    api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",  # Replace with your Portkey API key

    virtual_key="VIRTUAL_KEY"   # Replace with your virtual key for Stability AI

)
```
  </Tab>

</Tabs>



### **3\. Invoke Image Generation with** Stability AI

Use the Portkey instance to send requests to Stability AI. You can also override the virtual key directly in the API call if needed.
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
    ```js
    const image = await portkey.images.generate({

      model:"stable-diffusion-v1-6",

      prompt:"Lucy in the sky with diamonds",

      size:"1024x1024"

    })
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python SDK">
    ```
image = portkey.images.generate(

  model="stable-diffusion-v1-6",

  prompt="Lucy in the sky with diamonds",

  size="1024x1024"

)
```
  </Tab>

</Tabs>



Notice how we're using the OpenAI's image generation signature to prompt Stability allowing greater flexibility to change models and providers later if necessary.
