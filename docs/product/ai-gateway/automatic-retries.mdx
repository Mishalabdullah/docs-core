* Automatic retries are triggered **up to 5 times**
* Retries can also be triggered only on **specific error codes**
* And each subsequent retry attempt follows **exponential backoff strategy** to prevent network overload

## Enabling Retries

To enable retry, just add the `retry` param to your [config object](/docs/api-reference/config-object).

### Retry with 5 attempts

```JSON
{
    "retry": {
        "attempts": 5
    },
    "virtual_key": "virtual-key-xxx"
}
```

### Retry only on specific error codes

By default, Portkey triggers retries on the following error codes: **\[429, 500, 502, 503, 504\]**

You can change this behaviour by setting the optional `**on_status_codes**` param in your retry config and manually inputting the error codes on which rety will be triggered.


```JSON
{
  "retry": {
    "attempts": 3,
    "on_status_codes": [ 408, 429, 401 ]
  },
  "virtual_key": "virtual-key-xxx"
}
```

<Info>
  If the `on_status_codes` param is present, retries will be triggered **only** on the error codes specified in that Config and not on Portkey's default error codes for retries (i.e. \[429, 500, 502, 503, 504\])
</Info>

### Exponential backoff strategy

Here's how Portkey triggers retries following exponential backoff:

| Attempt           | Time out between requests |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| Initial Call      | Immediately               |
| Retry 1st attempt | 1 second                  |
| Retry 2nd attempt | 2 seconds                 |
| Retry 3rd attempt | 4 seconds                 |
| Retry 4th attempt | 8 seconds                 |
| Retry 5th attempt | 16 seconds                |
