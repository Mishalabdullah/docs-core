Portkey supports bringing your own Guardrail using a custom webhook:
<Frame>

</Frame>

Add `Webhook` as a Guardrail Check and setup any Guardrail Actions along with it. This is useful when you have an existing custom guardrail pipeline in your app and you are sending your LLM inputs or outputs to it for sync or async evaluation (such as a custom PII redactor). 

Bring that onto Portkey's Gateway, make it production-grade, and enforce LLM behavior in real-time, easily.

## Configuring Webhook in UI

In the Guardrail check UI, Portkey expects 3 things:
| Field | Description | Type |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Webhook URL** | The URL of your webhook | `string` |
| **Headers** | The headers your webhook expects, including `Authorization` | `JSON` |
| **Timeout** | Time to wait for the Webhook to respond | `number` (milliseconds) |

### Webhook URL 

This will be the publicly available URL of your webhook. 

<Note>
Portkey's Enterprise customers can configure the AI Gateway to securely access webhooks within your private networks as well.
</Note>

### Headers

Headers here should be a JSON object, like below:

```JSON
{
    "Authorization":"Bearer MY_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type":"application/json"
}
```

You can include any custom headers your webhook endpoint requires.

### Timeout

This is the time in milliseconds that Portkey's Gateway will wait for your webhook to respond. If your webhook doesn't respond within this timeout, Portkey will automatically return the Webhook verdict to be TRUE`.

Default timeout is `3000ms` (3 seconds).

## Expected Webhook Signature

When a request hits Portkey's Gateway with your webhook configured as a Guardrail check, Portkey makes a POST request to your webhook URL with the following payload:

```JSON
{
  "content": "The content to check (prompt or completion)",
  "metadata": {
    // Any metadata you sent along with your request
  }
}
```


Portkey makes a `POST` request to your webhook URL and expects two objects in the response: `verdict` and `data`.

### Custom Metadata

You can send any Metadata to your Webhook URL with Portkey's [Metadata header](/product/observability/metadata).
```py
"x-portkey-metadata": {"user":"john"}
```
When you make the request, Portkey will automatically forward all your metadata info to your Webhook URL. [More about Metadata here](/product/observability/metadata#adding-metadata-to-requests)

## Webhook Response

Portkey expects two objects: `verdict` and `data`

| Object  | Type    | Required? |
| ------- | ------- | --------- |
| `verdict` | `boolean` | Yes       |
| `data`   | `any`     | No        |

#### Here's a sample webhook response:


```JSON
{
  "verdict": true,
  "data": {
    "reason": "User passed all security checks",
    "score": 0.95,
    "additionalInfo": {
      "userStatus": "verified",
      "lastCheckTimestamp": "2024-08-21T14:30:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Check out the Webhook implementation here:

<Accordion title="https://github.com/Portkey-AI/gateway/blob/main/plugins/default/webhook.ts" href="https://github.com/Portkey-AI/gateway/blob/main/plugins/default/webhook.ts" icon="github" >

```js
import { PluginContext, PluginHandler, PluginParameters } from '../types';
import { post } from '../utils';

export const handler: PluginHandler = async (
  context: PluginContext,
  parameters: PluginParameters
) => {
  let error = null;
  let verdict = false;
  let data = null;
  try {
    let url = parameters.webhookURL;
    let headers: Record<string, string=""> = parameters?.headers
      ? JSON.parse(parameters.headers)
      : {};
    ({ verdict, data } = await post(url, context, { headers }, 3000));
  } catch (e: any) {
    delete e.stack;
    error = e;
  }
  return { error, verdict, data };
};
</string,>
```
</Accordion>


Based on the verdict value, the Guardrail Check will `PASS` or `FAIL`, and will have subsequent impact on the Guardrail Actions you've set.

<Info>
  The webhook request automatically time out after **3 seconds** \-this can not be changed. So, if a webhook request times out, the Guardrail verdict will return `PASS` for that request.
