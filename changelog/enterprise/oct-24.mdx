## `1.8.0`
<CodeGroup>
```sh Latest
docker pull portkeyai/gateway
```
```sh 1.8.0
docker pull portkeyai/gateway:1.8.0
```
</CodeGroup>
### Bedrock Converse API integration
- Bedrock's /chat/completions have been updated to use Bedrock converse API.
- This enables features like tool calls, vision, etc. for many bedrock models.
- This also removes the hassle of maintaining chat templating logic for llama and mistral models.

### Vertex Image Generation
- Added support for Vertex Imagen models.

### Stable Diffusion v2 Models
- StabilityAI introduced v2 models with a new API signature. Gateway now supports both v1 and v2 models, with internal transformations for different API signatures.
- Supported for both stability-ai and bedrock providers.
- New models: Stable Image Ultra, Core, 3.0 and 3.5.

### Pydantic SDK Integration for Structured Outputs
- Done for GoogleAI and VertexAI (follows OpenAI)
- We previously added support for structured outputs through REST API. However, SDKs using Pydantic were not supported due to extra fields in the JSON schema.
- Added a dereferencing function that converts JSON schemas from the library to Google-compatible schemas.

### OpenAI and AzureOpenAI Prompt Cache Pricing
- Added support for handling prompt caching pricing for required models.

### New Providers
- Lambda (`lambda`): Supports chat completions and completions.

### Fixes & Enhancements:
- Exclude files, batches, threads, etc. from llm_cost_sum prometheus metric. Apart from the unified routes, all other routes will be excluded from llm_cost_sum metric to avoid unnecessary labels.
- PerplexityAI: Added the missing [DONE] chunk for stream calls to comply with OpenAI's spec.
- VertexAI: Fixed provider name extraction logic for meta models, so users can send it like other partner models (e.g., meta.`<model-name>`).
- GoogleAI: Added structured outputs support (similar to Vertex-ai).
- Updated/Added pricing for new models.

### Block api.portkey.ai
- We now block Gateway routes for Enterprise Organisations (Configurable)
