The Gateway is your unified interface for **multimodal models**, along with chat, text, and embedding models.

Using the Gateway, you can call `vision`, `audio (text-to-speech & speech-to-text)`, `image generation` and other multimodal models from multiple providers (like `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, `Stability AI`, etc.) â€” all using the familiar OpenAI signature.
