Portkey provides a robust and secure gateway to facilitate the integration of various Large Language Models (LLMs) into your applications, including [Google Palm APIs](https://developers.generativeai.google/guide/palm%5Fapi%5Foverview).

With Portkey, you can take advantage of features like fast AI gateway access, observability, prompt management, and more, all while ensuring the secure management of your LLM API keys through a [virtual key](/docs/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys) system.

## Portkey SDK Integration with Google Palm

Portkey provides a consistent API to interact with models from various providers. To integrate Google Palm with Portkey:

### 1\. Install the Portkey SDK

Add the Portkey SDK to your application to interact with Google Palm's API through Portkey's gateway.
<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS">
        ```
        npm install --save portkey-ai
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python">
        ```
        pip install portkey-ai
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>



### 2\. Initialize Portkey with the Virtual Key

Set up Portkey with your virtual key as part of the initialization configuration. You can create a [virtual key](/docs/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys) for Google Palm in the UI.
<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
        ```
        import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'


        const portkey = new Portkey({

            apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY", // defaults to process.env["PORTKEY_API_KEY"]

            virtualKey: "VIRTUAL_KEY" // Your Google Palm Virtual Key

        })
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">
        ```
        from portkey_ai import Portkey

        portkey = Portkey(

            api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",  # Replace with your Portkey API key

            virtual_key="VIRTUAL_KEY"   # Replace with your virtual key for Google Palm

        )
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>




### **3\. Invoke Chat Completions with** Google Palm

Use the Portkey instance to send requests to Google Palm. You can also override the virtual key directly in the API call if needed.
<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
        ```
        const chatCompletion = await portkey.chat.completions.create({

            messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],

            model: 'chat-bison-001',

        });

        console.log(chatCompletion.choices);
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">
        ```
        completion = portkey.chat.completions.create(

            messages= [{ "role": 'user', "content": 'Say this is a test' }],

            model= 'chat-bison-001'

        )

        print(completion)
        ```
    </Tab>

</Tabs>


## Managing Google Palm Prompts

You can manage all prompts to Google Palm in the [Prompt Library](/docs/product/prompt-library). All the current models of Google Palm are supported and you can easily start testing different prompts.

Once you're ready with your prompt, you can use the `portkey.prompts.completions.create` interface to use the prompt in your application.
