Beyond all of these, some updates that are unique to Enterprise deployments only

Real-Time Model Pricing Sync

**Kicking off 2025 with major releases! ðŸŽ‰**

January marks a milestone for Portkey with our first industry report â€” we analyzed over 2 trillion tokens flowing through Portkey to find out production patterns for LLMs.

We're also expanding our platform capabilities with advanced PII redaction, JWT authentication, comprehensive audit logs, unified files & batches API, and support for private LLMs. Latest LLMs like Deepseek R1, OpenAI o3, and Gemini thinking model are also integrated with Portkey.

Plus, we are attending the [AI Engineer Summit in New York](https://x.com/PortkeyAI/status/1886629690615747020) in February, and hosting in-person meetups in [Mumbai](https://lu.ma/bgiyw0cy) & [NYC](https://lu.ma/vmf0egzl).

Let's dive in!

Our comprehensive analysis of 2T+ tokens processed through Portkey's Gateway reveals fascinating insights about how teams are deploying LLMs in production. Here are the key findings:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Multi-LLM is the New Normal">
Despite OpenAI's dominance (>50% of prod traffic), teams are actively implementing multi-LLM strategies for reliability and specialized use cases
</Card>
<Card title="Prompts are Getting Complex">
Average prompt size has increased 4x in the last year, indicating more sophisticated engineering techniques and complex workloads
</Card>
<Card title="Caching is Critical">
Implementation of proper caching strategies leads to up to 40% cost savings - a must-have for production deployments

## Platform

**Advanced PII Redaction**

We've significantly enhanced Portkey's Guardrails with request mutation capabilities.

When any sensitive data (like email, phone number, SSN) is detected in user requests, our PII redaction automatically replaces it with standardized identifiers before it reaches the LLM. This works seamlessly across our entire guardrails ecosystem, including AWS Bedrock Guardrails, Patronus AI, Promptfoo, Pangea, and more.


**Unified Files & Batches API**

Managing file uploads and batch processing across multiple LLM providers is now dramatically simpler. Instead of building provider-specific integrations, you can:
- **Upload once, use everywhere** - test your data across different foundation models
- **Run A/B tests seamlessly across providers** - Choose between native provider batching or Portkey's custom batch API

**Integrate Private LLMs**

You can now add your privately hosted LLMs to Portkey's virtual keys. Simply:
- Configure your model's base URL
- Set required authentication headers
- Start routing requests through our unified API

This means you can use your private deployments alongside commercial providers, with the same monitoring, reliability, and management features.

**API Keys with Default Configs & Metadata**

You can now attach default Portkey config & Metadata with any API key you create.
- Automatically monitor how a service/user is consuming Portkey API by enforcing metadata
- Apply Guardrails on requests automatically by adding them to Configs and attaching that to the key
- Set default fallbacks for outgoing request

## Enterprise

Running AI at scale requires robust security, visibility, and control. This month, we've launched a comprehensive set of enterprise features to enable that:

#### Authentication & Access Control
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure API access with JWT tokens, with support for JWKS URL and custom claims validation.
- **Workspace Management**: Manage workspace access and control who can view logs or create API keys from the Admin dashboard

#### Governance & Compliance
- **Metadata Schemas**: Enforce standardized request metadata across teams - crucial for governance and cost allocation
- **Audit Logging**: Track every critical action across both the Portkey app and Admin API, with detailed user attribution
- **Security Settings**: Expanded settings for managing logs visibility and API key creation

## Customer Love

After evaluating 17 different platforms, this AI team replaced 2+ years of homegrown tooling with Portkey Prompts.

They were able to do this because of three things:
- They could build reusable prompts with our partial templates
- Our versioning let them confidently roll out changes
- And they didn't have to refactor anything thanks to our OpenAI-compatible APIs
