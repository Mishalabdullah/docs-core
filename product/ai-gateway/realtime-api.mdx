[OpenAI's Realtime API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime) while the fastest way to use multi-modal generation, presents its own set of problems around logging, cost tracking and guardrails.

Portkey's AI Gateway provides a solution to these problems with a seamless integration. Portkeys logging is unique in that it captures the entire request and response, including the model's response, cost, and guardrail violations.

### Here's how to get started:

## Replace your endpoint URL from OpenAI with Portkey's endpoint URL

If you are using `gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-10-01`, then your URL would be `wss://api.portkey.ai/v1/realtime?model=gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-10-01`

## Add the following headers to your request

- `X-Portkey-Provider`: openai
- `X-Portkey-Api-Key`: PORTKEY_API_KEY
- `X-Portkey-Virtual-Key`: PORTKEY_VIRTUAL_KEY (refer: https://portkey.ai/docs/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys#virtual-keys)

For advanced use cases, you can use configs (https://portkey.ai/docs/product/ai-gateway/configs#configs)

If you would not like to store your API Keys with Portkey, you can pass your openai key in the `Authorization` header.

## Fire Away!

You can see your logs in realtime with neatly visualized traces and cost tracking.
