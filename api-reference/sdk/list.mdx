---

Set up your development environment to use Portkey in your favorite language. Portkey offers official SDKs for the most popular platforms, and is compatible with many OpenAI-style and community libraries.

<Info>Portkey's API is language-agnostic. You can use any HTTP client or OpenAI-compatible SDK to interact with Portkey's endpoints.</Info>

## Before You Begin

1. [Create an API key in the dashboard](https://app.portkey.ai).
2. Store your API key securely as an environment variable:

<CodeGroup>
```sh macOS/Linux
export PORTKEY_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```
```sh Windows(PowerShell)
setx PORTKEY_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>Official SDKs auto-detect your API key from the environment.</Note>
