description: Enterprise LDAP connectivity through modern identity bridges
---

Portkey provides LDAP integration support for enterprises through industry-standard identity provider bridges. This approach enables organizations to maintain their existing LDAP infrastructure while benefiting from modern cloud-native authentication protocols.

## Overview

Rather than implementing native LDAP support, Portkey leverages proven bridge solutions from leading identity providers. This strategy offers:

* **Enhanced Security**: Modern token-based authentication with MFA support
* **Improved Scalability**: Cloud-native architecture without on-premises limitations  
* **Reduced Complexity**: Leverage specialized identity provider expertise
* **Future-Ready**: Seamless path to modern protocols

## How LDAP Bridging Works

LDAP bridge solutions translate between your existing LDAP directory and Portkey's modern authentication protocols (SAML, OIDC, SCIM).

### Architecture Overview

```mermaid

    A[LDAP Directory] --> B[Identity Provider Bridge]
    B --> C[SCIM / SAML / OIDC]
    C --> D[Portkey]
```

The bridge maintains synchronization between your LDAP directory and the identity provider, enabling:

* **User Authentication**: LDAP credentials validated through SAML/OIDC
* **User Provisioning**: Directory changes synchronized via SCIM
* **Group Management**: LDAP groups mapped to Portkey workspaces
* **Attribute Mapping**: Custom LDAP attributes preserved

### Attribute Mapping

Ensure critical LDAP attributes map correctly:

| LDAP Attribute | SCIM Attribute | Portkey Field |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| uid/sAMAccountName | userName | username |
| mail | emails[primary] | email |
| givenName | name.givenName | firstName |
| sn | name.familyName | lastName |
| memberOf | groups | workspaces |
| title | title | jobTitle |

<Info>
  Custom LDAP attributes can be mapped through extended schema support in most identity providers.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Why doesn't Portkey support native LDAP?">
    Modern cloud architectures benefit from stateless, token-based protocols. LDAP's stateful binary protocol creates security and scalability challenges in cloud environments. Industry leaders like Slack, Salesforce, and others follow the same approach.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will this increase our costs?">
    While identity provider licenses add cost, most organizations see overall savings through:
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced infrastructure maintenance</li>
      <li>Improved security posture</li>
      <li>Decreased administrative overhead</li>
      <li>Better user experience</li>
    </ul>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does migration take?">
    Typical enterprise migrations complete in 3-6 months:
    <ul>
      <li>Small organizations (&lt;1,000 users): 4-8 weeks</li>
      <li>Medium organizations (1,000-10,000): 2-4 months</li>
      <li>Large enterprises (10,000+): 4-6 months</li>
    </ul>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can we maintain LDAP for other applications?">
    Yes, bridge solutions maintain your existing LDAP infrastructure. Other applications continue working unchanged while Portkey uses modern protocols.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>
