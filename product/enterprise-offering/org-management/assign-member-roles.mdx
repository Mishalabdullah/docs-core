## Overview

Portkey's organization management structure allows you to control which workspaces your team members can access and what actions they can perform within those workspaces. This feature enables fine-grained access control across your organization and ensures team members have appropriate permissions.

## Assigning Workspaces to Users

As an organization Owner or Admin, you can assign users to specific workspaces and define their roles during the invitation process or modify them afterward.

### Inviting New Team Members

1. Navigate to **Admin Settings** from the left sidebar
2. Select the **Team Members** tab
3. Click the **Add Team Member** button in the top-right corner
4. In the modal that appears:
   - Enter the user's email address
   - Select their organization-level role (Admin or Member)
   - Toggle the workspace assignment option (Optional)
   - Select specific workspaces to grant access to
   - Assign appropriate roles for each workspace (Admin, Manager, or Member)
5. Click **Send Invite** to complete the process

<Note>
  Organization-level Admins automatically have access to all workspaces with Admin privileges, regardless of specific workspace assignments.
</Note>

## Understanding User Roles

Portkey implements a hierarchical role-based access control system:

### Organization Level Roles

- **Owner**: Has full control over the organization, including user management, billing, and all platform features
- **Admin**: Has elevated privileges and access to all workspaces, can manage users, prompts, configs, guardrails, and API keys

### Workspace Level Roles

- **Manager**: Has administrative control within the assigned workspace, can add/remove team members, and manage workspace API keys
- **Member**: Has standard access to workspace resources and features as permitted by the Manager

## Managing Existing User Access

To modify workspace assignments or roles for existing team members:

1. Navigate to **Admin Settings** â†’ **Team Members**
2. Find the user in the team members list
3. Click the options menu (three dots) to the right of their entry
4. Select **Edit Workspaces**
5. Add or remove workspace assignments and adjust roles as needed
6. Save your changes

## Managing Workspace Access via API

For automated user management, you can also use the Admin API to assign users to workspaces and manage their roles.

## Best Practices

- **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users access only to the workspaces they need and with the minimum required permissions level
- **Regularly Audit Access**: Periodically review workspace assignments and roles to ensure they remain appropriate
- **Use Descriptive Workspace Names**: Clear naming conventions make it easier to manage which users should have access to which workspaces
