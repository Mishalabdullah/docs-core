---

Swarm is an experimental framework by OpenAI for building multi-agent systems. It showcases the handoff & routines pattern, making agent coordination and execution lightweight, highly controllable, and easily testable. Portkey integration extends Swarm's capabilities with production-ready features like observability, reliability, and more.


## Getting Started

<Steps>
<Step>
### 1\. Install the Portkey SDK
```sh
pip install -U portkey-ai
```
</Step>
<Step>
### 2\. Configure the LLM Client used in OpenAI Swarm

To build Swarm Agents with Portkey, you'll need two keys:

- **Portkey API Key**: Sign up on the [Portkey app](https://app.portkey.ai) and copy your API key.

-  **Virtual Key**: Virtual Keys are a secure way to manage your LLM API KEYS in one place. Instead of handling multiple API keys in your code, you can store your LLM provider API Keys securely in Portkey's vault


Create a Virtual Key in the [Portkey app](https://app.portkey.ai)

```py
from swarm import Swarm, Agent
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY", # defaults to os.environ.get("PORTKEY_API_KEY")
    virtual_key="YOUR_VIRTUAL_KEY" 
    )

client = Swarm(client=portkey)
```

</Step>
<Step>
### 3\. Create and Run an Agent
In this example we are building a simple Weather Agent using OpenAI Swarm with Portkey.
```py
def get_weather(location) -> str:
    return "{'temp':67, 'unit':'F'}"


agent = Agent(
    name="Agent",
    instructions="You are a helpful agent.",
    functions=[get_weather],
)

messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in NYC?"}]

response = client.run(agent=agent, messages=messages)
print(response.messages[-1]["content"])
```
</Step>

</Steps>


## E2E example with Function Calling in OpenAI Swarm
Here's a complete example showing function calling and agent interaction:
```py
from swarm import Swarm, Agent
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY", # defaults to os.environ.get("PORTKEY_API_KEY")
    virtual_key="YOUR_VIRTUAL_KEY" 
    )

client = Swarm(client=portkey)


def get_weather(location) -> str:
    return "{'temp':67, 'unit':'F'}"


agent = Agent(
    name="Agent",
    instructions="You are a helpful agent.",
    functions=[get_weather],
)

messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in NYC?"}]

response = client.run(agent=agent, messages=messages)
print(response.messages[-1]["content"])
```
> The current temperature in New York City is 67Â°F.

## 1. Interoperability - Calling Different LLMs

When building with Swarm, you might want to experiment with different LLMs or use specific providers for different agent tasks. Portkey makes this seamless - you can switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral, or cloud providers without changing your agent code.

Instead of managing multiple API keys and provider-specific configurations, Portkey's Virtual Keys give you a single point of control. Here's how you can use different LLMs with your Swarm agents:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Anthropic">
```python
portkey = Portkey(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    virtual_key="ANTHROPIC_VIRTUAL_KEY" #Just change the virtual key to your preferred LLM provider
)

client = Swarm(client=portkey)
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Azure OpenAI">
```python
portkey = Portkey(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    virtual_key="AZURE_OPENAI_VIRTUAL_KEY" #Just change the virtual key to your preferred LLM provider
)

client = Swarm(client=portkey)
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 2. Caching - Speed Up Agent Responses

Agent operations often involve repetitive queries or similar tasks. Every time your agent makes an LLM call, you're paying for tokens and waiting for responses. Portkey's caching system can significantly reduce both costs and latency.

Portkey offers two powerful caching modes:

**Simple Cache**: Perfect for exact matches - when your agents make identical requests. Ideal for deterministic operations like function calling or FAQ-type queries.

**Semantic Cache**: Uses embedding-based matching to identify similar queries. Great for natural language interactions where users might ask the same thing in different ways.

```python
config = {
    "cache": {
        "mode": "semantic",  # or "simple" for exact matching
        "max_age": 3600000  # cache duration in milliseconds
    }
}

portkey = Portkey(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    virtual_key="YOUR_VIRTUAL_KEY",
    config=config
)
```

## 3. Reliability - Keep Your Agents Running Smoothly

When running agents in production, things can go wrong - API rate limits, network issues, or provider outages. Portkey's reliability features ensure your agents keep running smoothly even when problems occur.

<CardGroup cols="2">
  <Card title="Automatic Retries" icon="rotate" href="../../product/ai-gateway/automatic-retries">
    Handles temporary failures automatically. If an LLM call fails, Portkey will retry the same request for the specified number of times - perfect for rate limits or network blips.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Request Timeouts" icon="clock" href="../../product/ai-gateway/request-timeouts">
    Prevent your agents from hanging. Set timeouts to ensure you get responses (or can fail gracefully) within your required timeframes.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Conditional Routing" icon="route" href="../../product/ai-gateway/conditional-routing">
    Send different requests to different providers. Route complex reasoning to GPT-4, creative tasks to Claude, and quick responses to Gemini based on your needs.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Fallbacks" icon="shield" href="../../product/ai-gateway/fallbacks">
    Keep running even if your primary provider fails. Automatically switch to backup providers to maintain availability.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Load Balancing" icon="scale-balanced" href="../../product/ai-gateway/load-balancing">
    Spread requests across multiple API keys or providers. Great for high-volume agent operations and staying within rate limits.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## 4. [Observability - Understand Your Agents](/product/observability)

Building agents is the first step - but how do you know they're working effectively? Portkey provides comprehensive visibility into your agent operations through multiple lenses:

#### Send Custom Metadata with your requests
Add trace IDs to track specific workflows:



```python
portkey = Portkey(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    virtual_key="YOUR_VIRTUAL_KEY",
    trace_id="weather_workflow_123",
    metadata={
        "agent": "weather_agent",
        "environment": "production"
    }
)
```





## 5. [Logs and Traces](/product/observability/logs)

Logs are essential for understanding agent behavior, diagnosing issues, and improving performance. They provide a detailed record of agent activities and tool use, which is crucial for debugging and optimizing processes.


Access a dedicated section to view records of agent executions, including parameters, outcomes, function calls, and errors. Filter logs based on multiple parameters such as trace ID, model, tokens used, and metadata.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Configure these settings in the [Portkey Dashboard](https://app.portkey.ai) or programmatically through the API.


## 7. Continuous Improvement

Now that you know how to trace & log your Llamaindex requests to Portkey, you can also start capturing user feedback to improve your app!

You can append qualitative as well as quantitative feedback to any `trace ID` with the `portkey.feedback.create` method:

```py Adding Feedback
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(
    api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    virtual_key="YOUR_OPENAI_VIRTUAL_KEY"
)

feedback = portkey.feedback.create(
    trace_id="YOUR_LLAMAINDEX_TRACE_ID",
    value=5,  # Integer between -10 and 10
    weight=1,  # Optional
    metadata={
        # Pass any additional context here like comments, _user and more
    }
)

print(feedback)
```



## [Portkey Config](/product/ai-gateway/configs)

Many of these features are driven by Portkey's Config architecture. The Portkey app simplifies creating, managing, and versioning your Configs.

For more information on using these features and setting up your Config, please refer to the [Portkey documentation](https://docs.portkey.ai).
