Portkey provides a robust and secure platform to observe, integrate, and manage your **locally or privately hosted custom models using vLLM.**

Here is a list of [supported model](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html) architecture that are currently supported by vLLM.

## Integrating Custom Models with Portkey SDK

vLLM provides an HTTP server that implements OpenAI's Completions and Chat API. Since Portkey's AI Gateway is OpenAI-compliant, you can easily integrate any custom LLM hosted using vLLM with Portkey.

### 1\. Install the Portkey SDK

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS">
        ```sh
        npm install --save portkey-ai
        ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python">
        ```sh
        pip install portkey-ai
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>




### 2\. Initialize Portkey with vLLM custom URL

To integrate Portkey with vLLM, you need to configure the Portkey client this way- 
1. `provider: "openai"` We'll use provider as openai because vLLM provides an OpenAI-compliant HTTP server. 
2. Custom Host: `customHost: "http://localhost:8000/v1"` vLLM server's  default endpoint.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
        ```js
        import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'

        const portkey = new Portkey({
            apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY",
            provider: "openai", // This can be mistral-ai, openai, or anything else
            customHost: "http://localhost:8000/v1", // Your custom URL with version identifier, Default: 8000 for vLLM
            authorization: "AUTH_KEY", // If you need to pass auth
        })
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">
        ```python
        from portkey_ai import Portkey

        portkey = Portkey(
            api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",
            provider="openai", # This can be mistral-ai, openai, or anything else
            custom_host="http://localhost:8000/v1", # Your custom URL with version identifier, Default: 8000 for vLLM
            authorization="AUTH_KEY", # If you need to pass auth
        )
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>

### 3\. Invoke Chat Completions

Use the Portkey SDK to invoke chat completions from your model, just as you would with any other provider.


<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
        ```js
        const chatCompletion = await portkey.chat.completions.create({
            messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }]
        });

        console.log(chatCompletion.choices);
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">

```python
completion = portkey.chat.completions.create(
    messages= [{ "role": 'user', "content": 'Say this is a test' }]
)

print(completion)
```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>
