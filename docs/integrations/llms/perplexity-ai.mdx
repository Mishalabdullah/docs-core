Portkey provides a robust and secure gateway to facilitate the integration of various Large Language Models (LLMs) into your applications, including [Perplexity AI APIs](https://docs.perplexity.ai/reference/post%5Fchat%5Fcompletions).

With Portkey, you can take advantage of features like fast AI gateway access, observability, prompt management, and more, all while ensuring the secure management of your LLM API keys through a [virtual key](/docs/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys) system.

## Portkey SDK Integration with Perplexity AI Models

Portkey provides a consistent API to interact with models from various providers. To integrate Perplexity AI with Portkey:

### 1\. Install the Portkey SDK

Add the Portkey SDK to your application to interact with Perplexity AI's API through Portkey's gateway.
<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
        ```
        npm install --save portkey-ai
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">
        ```
        pip install portkey-ai
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>



### 2\. Initialize Portkey with the Virtual Key

To use Perplexity AI with Portkey, [get your API key from here,](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api) then add it to Portkey to create the virtual key.
<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
        ```js
        import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'


        const portkey = new Portkey({

            apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY", // defaults to process.env["PORTKEY_API_KEY"]

            virtualKey: "VIRTUAL_KEY" // Your Perplexity AI Virtual Key

        })
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">
        ```python
        from portkey_ai import Portkey

        portkey = Portkey(

            api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",  # Replace with your Portkey API key

            virtual_key="VIRTUAL_KEY"   # Replace with your virtual key for Perplexity AI

        )
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>


### **3\. Invoke Chat Completions with** Perplexity AI

Use the Portkey instance to send requests to Perplexity AI. You can also override the virtual key directly in the API call if needed.
<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
        ```js
        const chatCompletion = await portkey.chat.completions.create({

            messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],

            model: 'pplx-70b-chat',

        });

        console.log(chatCompletion.choices);
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">
        ```python
        completion = portkey.chat.completions.create(

            messages= [{ "role": 'user', "content": 'Say this is a test' }],

            model= 'pplx-70b-chat'

        )

        print(completion)
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>




## Managing Perplexity AI Prompts

You can manage all prompts to Perplexity AI in the [Prompt Library](/docs/product/prompt-library). All the current models of Perplexity AI are supported and you can easily start testing different prompts.

Once you're ready with your prompt, you can use the `portkey.prompts.completions.create` interface to use the prompt in your application.
