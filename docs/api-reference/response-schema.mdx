With each request, Portkey sends back **Portkey-specific** headers that can help you identify the state of specific Portkey features you are using.

We send the following 4 response headers:

| Header                               | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`x-portkey-trace-id`**               | Returns a **`unique trace id`** for each response. In case the user has already sent a trace id with x-portkey-trace-id in their **`request body,`** then that is used here instead of generating a new id.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **`x-portkey-retry-attempt-count`**    | Returns the number of **`retry attempts`** made for the call. Request made for the first time is not counted, **`only`** the attempts are counted. So, if the value is 3, that means that a total of 4 (1+3) calls were made.                                                                                                                                               |
| **`x-portkey-cache-status`**           | Returns the **`cache status`** for the call. • HIT (simple cache hit) • SEMANTIC HIT (semantic cache hit) • MISS (simple cache header was sent in the request, but returned a miss) • SEMANTIC MISS (semantic cache header was sent in the request, but returned a miss) • DISABLED (no cache header sent) • REFRESH (cache force refresh was true in the request header) |
| **`x-portkey-last-used-option-index`** | Returns the nested **`target index`** (as jsonpath) for the Config id used while making the call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
