## Versioning Prompts

Whenever any changes are made to your prompt template, Portkey saves your changes in the browser **but** they are **not pushed** to Portkey. You can click on the `Update` button on the top right to save the latest version of the prompt on Portkey.

**All** of your prompt versions can be seen on the right column of the playground:

You can `Restore` or `Publish` any of the previous versions by clicking on the elipsis.

## Using Different Prompt Versions

By default, when you pass the `PROMPT_ID` in `prompts.completions.create` method, Portkey sends the request to the `Published` version of your prompt.

But, you can also call any of the other prompt versions (that you can see on the right side bar) by appending their version numbers with the `PROMPT_ID` slug.

**For example,**


```js
response = portkey.prompts.completions.create(
    prompt_id="pp-classification-prompt@12",
    variables={ }
)
```

Here, I am sending my request to **Version #12** of my prompt template. Portkey also has the `latest` tag that will always send the request to the **latest available version** of your prompt, regardless if it's published or not.


```js
response = portkey.prompts.completions.create(
    prompt_id="pp-classification-prompt@latest",
    variables={ }
)
```

* `latest` refers to the last version of prompt, it may not be the same as the `Published` version of your prompt.
* When no suffix is provided, Portkey defaults to send the request to the `Published` version of the prompt

This feature allows you to easily switch between different versions of your prompts for experimenting or specific use cases without affecting your production environment.

## Prompt Labels

You can add version tags/labels like `staging`, `production` to any prompt version to track changes, and call them directly:

<CodeGroup>
    ```ts @staging {2}
    const promptCompletion = portkey.prompts.completions.create({
        promptID: "pp-article-xx@staging",
        variables: {"":""}
    })
    ```
    ```ts @dev {2}
    const promptCompletion = portkey.prompts.completions.create({
        promptID: "pp-article-xx@dev",
        variables: {"":""}
    })
    ```
    ```ts @prod {2}
    const promptCompletion = portkey.prompts.completions.create({
        promptID: "pp-article-xx@prod",
        variables: {"":""}
    })
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
    - There are 3 default labels: `production`, `staging`, `development` which can not be removed.
    - Custom labels are unique to the workspace where they are created.
    - If you delete a custom label, any prompt completion requests to that label will start failing.

## Publishing Prompts

Updating the Prompt does not automatically update your prompt in production. While updating, you can tick `Publish prompt changes` which will also update your prompt deployment to the latest version.
