Allow models to use remote MCP servers to perform tasks.

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide tools and context to LLMs. The MCP tool in the Responses API allows developers to give the model access to tools hosted on **Remote MCP servers**. These are MCP servers maintained by developers and organizations across the internet that expose these tools to MCP clients, like the Responses API.

Calling a remote MCP server with the Responses API is straightforward. For example, here's how you can use the [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/) MCP server to ask questions about nearly any public GitHub repository.

A Responses API request with MCP tools enabled

It is very important that developers trust any remote MCP server they use with the Responses API. A malicious server can exfiltrate sensitive data from anything that enters the model's context. Carefully review the [Risks and Safety](#risks-and-safety) section below before using this tool.

The MCP ecosystem
---

We are still in the early days of the MCP ecosystem. Some popular remote MCP servers today include [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/guides/remote-mcp-server/), [Hubspot](https://developers.hubspot.com/mcp), [Intercom](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/mcp), [Paypal](https://developer.paypal.com/tools/mcp-server/), [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/mcp/openai/), [Plaid](https://plaid.com/docs/mcp/), [Shopify](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/storefront-mcp), [Stripe](https://docs.stripe.com/mcp), [Square](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/mcp), [Twilio](https://github.com/twilio-labs/function-templates/tree/main/mcp-server) and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/mcp). We expect many more servers—and registries making it easy to discover these servers—to launch in the coming months. The MCP protocol itself is also early, and we expect to add many more updates to our MCP tool as the protocol evolves.

How it works
--

The MCP tool works only in the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses/create), and is available across all our new models (gpt-4o, gpt-4.1, and our reasoning models). When you're using the MCP tool, you only pay for [tokens](/docs/pricing) used when importing tool definitions or making tool calls—there are no additional fees involved.

### Step 1: Getting the list of tools from the MCP server

The first thing the Responses API does when you attach a remote MCP server to the `tools` array, is attempt to get a list of tools from the server. The Responses API supports remote MCP servers that support either the Streamable HTTP or the HTTP/SSE transport protocol.

If successful in retrieving the list of tools, a new `mcp_list_tools` output item will be visible in the Response object that is created for each MCP server. The `tools` property of this object will show the tools that were successfully imported.

```json
{
  "id": "mcpl_682d4379df088191886b70f4ec39f90403937d5f622d7a90",
  "type": "mcp_list_tools",
  "server_label": "deepwiki",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "read_wiki_structure",
      "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "repoName": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "GitHub repository: owner/repo (e.g. \"facebook/react\")"
          }
        },
        "required": [
          "repoName"
        ],
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "annotations": null,
        "description": "",
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"
      }
    },
    // ... other tools
  ]
}
```

As long as the `mcp_list_tools` item is present in the context of the model, we will not attempt to pull a refreshed list of tools from an MCP server. We recommend you keep this item in the model's context as part of every conversation or workflow execution to optimize for latency.

#### Filtering tools

Some MCP servers can have dozens of tools, and exposing many tools to the model can result in high cost and latency. If you're only interested in a subset of tools an MCP server exposes, you can use the `allowed_tools` parameter to only import those tools.

Constrain allowed tools


<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "mcp",
      "server_label": "deepwiki",
      "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
      "require_approval": "never",
      "allowed_tools": ["ask_question"]
    }
  ],
  "input": "What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec (modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) support?"
}'
```

```javascript OpenAI Node SDK
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const resp = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [{
        type: "mcp",
        server_label: "deepwiki",
        server_url: "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
        require_approval: "never",
        allowed_tools: ["ask_question"],
    }],
    input: "What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec (modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) support?",
});

console.log(resp.output_text);
```

```python OpenAI Python SDK
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[{
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "deepwiki",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "allowed_tools": ["ask_question"],
    }],
    input="What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec (modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) support?",
)

print(resp.output_text)
```


</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Calling tools

Once the model has access to these tool definitions, it may choose to call them depending on what's in the model's context. When the model decides to call an MCP tool, we make an request to the remote MCP server to call the tool, take it's output and put that into the model's context. This creates an `mcp_call` item which looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "mcp_682d437d90a88191bf88cd03aae0c3e503937d5f622d7a90",
  "type": "mcp_call",
  "approval_request_id": null,
  "arguments": "{\"repoName\":\"modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol\",\"question\":\"What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec support?\"}",
  "error": null,
  "name": "ask_question",
  "output": "The 2025-03-26 version of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification supports two standard transport mechanisms: `stdio` and `Streamable HTTP` ...",
  "server_label": "deepwiki"
}
```

As you can see, this includes both the arguments the model decided to use for this tool call, and the `output` that the remote MCP server returned. All models can choose to make multiple (MCP) tool calls in the Responses API, and so, you may see several of these items generated in a single Response API request.

Failed tool calls will populate the error field of this item with MCP protocol errors, MCP tool execution errors, or general connectivity errors. The MCP errors are documented in the MCP spec [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/server/tools#error-handling).

#### Approvals

By default, OpenAI will request your approval before any data is shared with a remote MCP server. Approvals help you maintain control and visibility over what data is being sent to an MCP server. We highly recommend that you carefully review (and optionally, log) all data being shared with a remote MCP server. A request for an approval to make an MCP tool call creates a `mcp_approval_request` item in the Response's output that looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "mcpr_682d498e3bd4819196a0ce1664f8e77b04ad1e533afccbfa",
  "type": "mcp_approval_request",
  "arguments": "{\"repoName\":\"modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol\",\"question\":\"What transport protocols are supported in the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec?\"}",
  "name": "ask_question",
  "server_label": "deepwiki"
}
```

You can then respond to this by creating a new Response object and appending an `mcp_approval_response` item to it.

Here we're using the `previous_response_id` parameter to chain this new Response, with the previous Response that generated the approval request. But you can also pass back the [outputs from one response, as inputs into another](/docs/guides/conversation-state#manually-manage-conversation-state) for maximum control over what enter's the model's context.

If and when you feel comfortable trusting a remote MCP server, you can choose to skip the approvals for reduced latency. To do this, you can set the `require_approval` parameter of the MCP tool to an object listing just the tools you'd like to skip approvals for like shown below, or set it to the value `'never'` to skip approvals for all tools in that remote MCP server.

Never require approval for some tools

Authentication
--------------

Unlike the DeepWiki MCP server, most other MCP servers require authentication. The MCP tool in the Responses API gives you the ability to flexibly specify headers that should be included in any request made to a remote MCP server. These headers can be used to share API keys, oAuth access tokens, or any other authentication scheme the remote MCP server implements.

The most common header used by remote MCP servers is the `Authorization` header. This is what passing this header looks like:

To prevent the leakage of sensitive keys, the Responses API does not store the values of **any** string you provide in the `headers` object. These values will also not be visible in the Response object created. Additionally, because some remote MCP servers generate authenticated URLs, we also discard the _path_ portion of the `server_url` in our responses (i.e. `example.com/mcp` becomes `example.com`). Because of this, you must send the full path of the MCP `server_url` and any relevant `headers` in every Responses API creation request you make.
