title: Portkey at TEDAI Hackathon 2024
---

Welcome to the TED AI Hackathon! We're thrilled to see what you'll build.
We've made getting started as easy as possible — don't worry about LLM costs or other hurdles. We've got you covered.

<Note>
Portkey is offering $100 in LLM credits to all hackathon teams!
</Note>

### Steps to Redeem Your Credits

1. Reach out to `vru.shank` on the TEDAI Discord server. He's hanging out on the #portkey channel
2. DM your team name, and Vrushank will share your credit details with you - we're sharing 1 Portkey API key with 1 provider virtual key of your choosing
3. Browse our [integration docs](/integrations/llms) to learn how easy it is to call any LLM using Portkey — we route to 250+ LLMs , all using the common OpenAI API schema

That's it! Reach out to Vrushank on Discord or email (vrushank.v@portkey.ai) for any help or support!

Happy Hacking! `
