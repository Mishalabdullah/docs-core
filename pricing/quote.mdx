### 1. Deployment Model & Usage Pricing

Your deployment model is the biggest factor in determining your base price and cost structure. We offer three patterns to fit any enterprise architecture.

All enterprise deployment options include comprehensive security features such as SOC2, ISO27001, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance certifications, PII anonymization, custom data retention policies, and encryption at rest and in transit.


<Note>
**Key Consideration: Usage-Based Pricing**

For SaaS and Hybrid plans, costs are influenced by the number of requests your gateways process. This pay-as-you-grow model is cost-effective for teams scaling their AI usage.

The Air-gapped plan is different: it comes with a flat annual license fee, giving you predictable costs with zero usage-based charges, no matter how many requests you send.
</Note>


### 2. Production Gateway Deployments
<Info>
*Only relevant for Hybrid and Air-gapped deployments.*
</Info>

This lever allows you to align costs with the breadth of your implementation.


Your base enterprise license includes **one (1) production gateway deployment**. You can add more licenses for additional deployments, such as for different business units, cloud providers, or geographic regions.

**The Base Package Includes:**
- 1 production gateway deployment
- Unlimited staging/development gateways
- Unlimited horizontal and vertical scaling

**Additional Production Deployments:**
- Each additional production gateway is charged separately

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What Qualifies as a Separate Production Deployment?">
    • Multi-cloud deployments (AWS + Azure + GCP) <br />
    • Geographic distribution (US + EU + APAC) <br />
    • Isolated business unit deployments <br />
    • Dedicated customer environments <br />
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Development & Staging Environments">
    • Unlimited dev/staging gateways on each license <br />
    • No additional charges for non-production use <br />
    • Full feature parity with production <br />
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Gateway Request Volume

<Info>
*This lever applies to SaaS and Hybrid deployments only. Airgapped deployments have unlimited, unmetered usage.*
</Info>

Your monthly Portkey bill for SaaS and Hybrid deployments is influenced by the total number of requests processed through your enterprise gateway.

- **Included Usage:**  
  Every contract includes a generous baseline of monthly requests (customized for your use case and projected volume).

- **Transparent Overage Pricing:**  
  If your usage exceeds the included tier, additional requests are billed at a pre-negotiated, predictable rate—no hidden fees or surprise spikes.

- **Scale With Confidence:**  
  Pricing is designed to align with your actual AI adoption. As your organization’s LLM usage grows, you pay only for what you use, with volume discounts available for high-throughput teams.

- **Unlimited Usage for Airgapped:**  
  On fully airgapped deployments, Portkey does **not** meter or charge for requests—run as many as you need with zero usage-based costs.
