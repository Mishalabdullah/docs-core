description: Complete guide to integrate OpenAI API with Portkey. Support for gpt-4o, o1, chat completions, vision, and audio APIs with built-in reliability and monitoring features.
---

<ResponseField name="Provider Slug" type="openai">
[Latest Pricing](https://models.portkey.ai/providers/openai) | [API Status](https://status.portkey.ai/) | [Supported Endpoints](/api-reference/inference-api/supported-providers)
</ResponseField>

OpenAI's API offers powerful language, embedding, and multimodal models (gpt-4o, o1, whisper). Portkey adds production-ready features like observability, fallbacks, and guardrails, supporting all OpenAI endpoints from chat, fine-tuning, batches, and more.


## Integrate
Just paste your OpenAI API Key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to [Portkey](https://app.portkey.ai/virtual-keys) to create your Virtual Key.
<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/openai/virtual-key-2.png" width="350" />
</Frame>
Your OpenAI personal or service account API keys can be saved to Portkey. Additionally, your **[OpenAI Admin API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/admin-keys)** can also be saved to Portkey so that you can route to OpenAI Admin routes through Portkey API.

<Info>
Optional
- Add your OpenAI organization and project ID details: ([Docs](#openai-projects-and-organizations))
- Directly use OpenAI API key without the  Virtual Key: ([Docs](/api-reference/inference-api/headers#1-provider-slug-auth))
- Create a short-lived virtual key OR one with usage/rate limits: ([Docs](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys))
</Info>
<Note>
Note: While OpenAI supports setting budget & rate limits at Project level, on Portkey, along with that, you can set granular budget & rate limits per each key.
</Note>

## Sample Request
Portkey is a drop-in replacement for OpenAI. You can make request using the official OpenAI or Portkey SDKs.
<Note>
Popular libraries & agent frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, etc. are [also supported](#popular-libraries).
All Azure OpenAI models & endpoints are [also supported](/integrations/llms/azure-openai)

#### OpenAI Vision

OpenAI's vision models can analyze images alongside text, enabling visual question-answering capabilities. Images can be provided via URLs or base64 encoding in user messages.

<CodeGroup>
```py Python
response = portkey.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4-vision-preview",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "What's in this image?"},
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg",
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
    max_tokens=300,
)

print(response)
```

```ts Node.js
const response = await portkey.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4-vision-preview",
  messages: [

         }
       ],
       "max_tokens": 300
     }'
```
</CodeGroup>

**Uploading Base64 encoded images**

If you have an image or set of images locally, you can pass those to the model in base 64 encoded format. [Check out this example from OpenAI on how to do this](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision#uploading-base64-encoded-images).

#### OpenAI Embeddings

OpenAI's embedding models (like `text-embedding-3-small`) transform text inputs into lists of floating point numbers - smaller distances between vectors indicate higher text similarity. They power use cases like semantic search, content clustering, recommendations, and anomaly detection.

Simply send text to the embeddings API endpoint to generate these vectors for your applications.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
response = portkey.embeddings.create(
    input="Your text string goes here",
    model="text-embedding-3-small"
)

print(response.data[0].embedding)
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await portkey.embeddings.create({
  input: "Your text string goes here",
  model: "text-embedding-3-small"
});

console.log(response.data[0].embedding);
```

```curl REST
curl -X POST "https://api.portkey.ai/v1/embeddings" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY" \
     -d '{
       "input": "Your text string goes here",
       "model": "text-embedding-3-small"
     }'
```
</CodeGroup>

#### OpenAI Prompt Caching

Prompt caching automatically reuses results from similar API requests, reducing latency by up to 80% and costs by 50%. This feature works by default for all OpenAI API calls, requires no setup, and has no additional fees.

Portkey accurately logs the usage statistics and costs for your cached requests.

#### OpenAI Image Generations

OpenAI's Images API enables AI-powered image generation, manipulation, and variation creation for creative and commercial applications. Whether you're building image generation features, editing tools, or creative applications, the API provides powerful visual AI capabilities through DALLÂ·E models.

The API offers three core capabilities:
- Generate new images from text prompts (DALLÂ·E 3, DALLÂ·E 2)
- Edit existing images with text-guided replacements (DALLÂ·E 2)
- Create variations of existing images (DALLÂ·E 2)

<CodeGroup>
    ```ts Node.js
    import Portkey from 'portkey-ai';

    const client = new Portkey({
      apiKey: 'PORTKEY_API_KEY',
      virtualKey: 'PROVIDER_VIRTUAL_KEY'
    });

    async function main() {
      const image = await client.images.generate({

### Portkey Features

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Track End-User IDs">

Portkey allows you to track user IDs passed with the user parameter in OpenAI requests, enabling you to monitor user-level costs, requests, and more:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
response = portkey.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o",
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test"}],
  user="user_123456"
)
```

```javascript Node.js
const chatCompletion = await portkey.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Say this is a test" }],
  model: "gpt-4o",
  user: "user_12345",
});
```

```curl REST
curl -X POST "https://api.portkey.ai/v1/chat/completions" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY" \
     -d '{
       "model": "gpt-4o",
       "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test"}],
       "user": "user_123456"
     }'
```
</CodeGroup>

When you include the user parameter in your requests, Portkey logs will display the associated user ID, as shown in the image below:

<img src="/images/llms/logs.png" alt="Portkey Logs with User ID" />

In addition to the `user` parameter, Portkey allows you to send arbitrary custom metadata with your requests. This powerful feature enables you to associate additional context or information with each request, which can be useful for analysis, debugging, or other custom use cases.

<Accordion title="Setup Fallbacks & Loadbalancer">

Here's a simplified version of how to use Portkey's Gateway Configuration:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Gateway Configuration" titleSize="h3">
    You can create a Gateway configuration using the Portkey Config Dashboard or by writing a JSON configuration in your code. In this example, requests are routed based on the user's subscription plan (paid or free).

    ```json
    config = {
      "strategy": {
        "mode": "conditional",
        "conditions": [
          {
            "query": { "metadata.user_plan": { "$eq": "paid" } },
            "then": "gpt4o"
          },
          {
            "query": { "metadata.user_plan": { "$eq": "free" } },
            "then": "gpt-3.5"
          }
        ],
        "default": "base-gpt4"
      },
      "targets": [
        {
          "name": "gpt4o",
          "virtual_key": "xx"
        },
        {
          "name": "gpt-3.5",
          "virtual_key": "yy"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Process Requests" titleSize="h3">
    When a user makes a request, it will pass through Portkey's AI Gateway. Based on the configuration, the Gateway routes the request according to the user's metadata.
    <img src="/images/llms/conditional-routing.png" alt="Conditional Routing Diagram" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up the Portkey Client" titleSize="h3">
    Pass the Gateway configuration to your Portkey client. You can either use the config object or the Config ID from Portkey's hosted version.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    from portkey_ai import Portkey

    portkey = Portkey(
        api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        virtual_key="VIRTUAL_KEY",
        config=portkey_config
    )
    ```

    ```javascript Node.js
    import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'

    const portkey = new Portkey({
      apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY",
      virtualKey: "VIRTUAL_KEY",
      config: portkeyConfig
    })
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Accordion title="Setup Guardrails">

Portkey's AI gateway enables you to enforce input/output checks on requests by applying custom hooks before and after processing. Protect your user's/company's data by using PII guardrails and many more available on Portkey Guardrails:

```json
{
	"virtual_key":"openai-xxx",
	"before_request_hooks": [{
		"id": "input-guardrail-id-xx"
	}],
	"after_request_hooks": [{

### OpenAI Projects & Organizations
<Accordion title="Managing OpenAI Orgs on Portkey">
Organization management is particularly useful if you belong to multiple organizations or are accessing projects through a legacy OpenAI user API key. Specifying the organization and project IDs also helps you maintain better control over your access rules, usage, and costs.

In Portkey, you can add your OpenAI Org & Project details by **Using Virtual Keys**, **Using Configs**, or **While Making a Request**.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Using Virtual Keys">

When selecting OpenAI from the Virtual Key dropdown menu while creating a virtual key, Portkey displays optional fields for the organization ID and project ID alongside the API key field.
<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/openai/virtual-key-2.png" width="500" />
</Frame>
<Info>
Portkey takes budget management a step further than OpenAI. While OpenAI allows setting budget limits per project, Portkey enables you to set budget limits for each virtual key you create. For more information on budget limits, [refer to this documentation](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys/budget-limits)
</Info>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Using Configs">

You can also specify the organization and project details in your request config, either at the root level or within a specific target.

```json {3,4}
{
	"provider": "openai",
	"api_key": "OPENAI_API_KEY",
	"openai_organization": "org-xxxxxx",
	"openai_project": "proj_xxxxxxxx"
}
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="While Making a Request">

Pass OpenAI organization and project details directly when making a request:

<CodeGroup>
```python OpenAI Python

#### Limitations for Vision Requests
- Medical images: Vision models are not suitable for interpreting specialized medical images like CT scans and shouldn't be used for medical advice.
- Non-English: The models may not perform optimally when handling images with text of non-Latin alphabets, such as Japanese or Korean.
- Small text: Enlarge text within the image to improve readability, but avoid cropping important details.
- Rotation: The models may misinterpret rotated / upside-down text or images.
- Visual elements: The models may struggle to understand graphs or text where colors or styles like solid, dashed, or dotted lines vary.
- Spatial reasoning: The models struggle with tasks requiring precise spatial localization, such as identifying chess positions.
- Accuracy: The models may generate incorrect descriptions or captions in certain scenarios.
- Image shape: The models struggle with panoramic and fisheye images.
- Metadata and resizing: The models do not process original file names or metadata, and images are resized before analysis, affecting their original dimensions.
- Counting: May give approximate counts for objects in images.
- CAPTCHAS: For safety reasons, CAPTCHA submissions are blocked by OpenAI.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Vision FAQs
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I fine-tune OpenAI models on vision requests?">
Vision fine-tuning is available for [some OpenAI models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning#vision).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use gpt-4o or other chat models to generate images?">
No, you can use dall-e-3 to generate images and gpt-4o and other chat models to understand images.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What type of files can I upload for vision requests?">
OpenAI currently supports PNG (.png), JPEG (.jpeg and .jpg), WEBP (.webp), and non-animated GIF (.gif).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="For vision requests, Iis there a limit to the size of the image I can upload?">
OpenAI currently restricts image uploads to 20MB per image.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do rate limits work for vision requests?">
OpenAI processes images at the token level, so each image that's processed counts towards your tokens per minute (TPM) limit. See how OpenAI [calculates costs here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision#calculating-costs) for details on the formula used to determine token count per image.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can models understand image metadata?">
No, the models do not receive image metadata.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Embedding FAQs
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How can I tell how many tokens a string has before I embed it?">
[This cookbook by OpenAI](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken) illustrates how to leverage their Tiktoken library to count tokens for various embedding requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I retrieve K nearest embedding vectors quickly?">
Using a specialized vector database helps here. [Check out this cookbook by OpenAI](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/vector_databases/readme) for a deep dive.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Do V3 embedding models know about recent events?">
The cutoff date for V3 embedding models (`text-embedding-3-large` & `text-embedding-3-small`) is **September 2021** - so they do not know about the most recent events.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Prompt Caching FAQs
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How is data privacy maintained for caches?">
OpenAI Prompt caches are not shared between organizations. Only members of the same organization can access caches of identical prompts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does Prompt Caching affect output token generation or the final response of the API?">
  Prompt Caching does not influence the generation of output tokens or the final response provided by the API. Regardless of whether caching is used, the output generated will be identical. This is because only the prompt itself is cached, while the actual response is computed anew each time based on the cached prompt.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is there a way to manually clear the cache?">
Manual cache clearing is not currently available. Prompts that have not been encountered recently are automatically cleared from the cache. Typical cache evictions occur after 5-10 minutes of inactivity, though sometimes lasting up to a maximum of one hour during off-peak periods.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Will I be expected to pay extra for writing to Prompt Caching?">
No. Caching happens automatically, with no explicit action needed or extra cost paid to use the caching feature.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Do cached prompts contribute to TPM rate limits?">
Yes, as caching does not affect rate limits.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is discounting for Prompt Caching available on Scale Tier and the Batch API?">
Discounting for Prompt Caching is not available on the Batch API but is available on Scale Tier. With Scale Tier, any tokens that are spilled over to the shared API will also be eligible for caching.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does Prompt Caching work on Zero Data Retention requests?">
Yes, Prompt Caching is compliant with existing Zero Data Retention policies.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How long do the generated image URLs last?">
Generated image URLs expire after one hour. Download or process the images before expiration.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What are the size requirements for uploading images?">
Images must be square PNG files under 4MB. For editing features, both the image and mask must have identical dimensions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I disable DALLÂ·E 3's automatic prompt enhancement?">
While you can't completely disable it, you can add "I NEED to test how the tool works with extremely simple prompts. DO NOT add any detail, just use it AS-IS:" to your prompt.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How many images can I generate per request?">
DALLÂ·E 3 supports 1 image per request (use parallel requests for more), while DALLÂ·E 2 supports up to 10 images per request.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What image formats are supported?">
The API requires PNG format for all image uploads and manipulations. Generated images can be returned as either a URL or Base64 data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does image editing (inpainting) work?">
Available only in DALLÂ·E 2, inpainting requires both an original image and a mask. The transparent areas of the mask indicate where the image should be edited, and your prompt should describe the complete new image, not just the edited area.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
