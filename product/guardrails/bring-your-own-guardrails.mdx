Portkey supports bringing your own Guardrail using a custom webhook:

</Frame>

Add `Webhook` as a Guardrail Check and setup any Guardrail Actions along with it. This is useful when you have an existing custom guardrail pipeline in your app and you are sending your LLM inputs or outputs to it for sync or async evaluation. Bring that onto Portkey's Gateway, make it production-grade, and enforce LLM behavior in real-time, easily.

## How Custom Webhook Works

In the Guardrail check, Portkey expects your `Webhook URL` and any `headers` (including `Authorization`) you need to send.

### Headers

Headers here should be a JSON object, like below:

```JSON
{
    "Authorization":"MY_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type":"Application/JSON"
}
```

Portkey makes a `POST` request to your webhook URL and expects two objects in the response: `verdict` and `data`.

### Custom Metadata

You can send any Metadata to your Webhook URL with Portkey's [Metadata header](/product/observability/metadata).
```py
"x-portkey-metadata": {"user":"john"}
```
When you make the request, Portkey will automatically forward all your metadata info to your Webhook URL. [More about Metadata here](/product/observability/metadata#adding-metadata-to-requests)

## Webhook Response

Portkey expects two objects: `verdict` and `data`

| Object  | Type    | Required? |
| ------- | ------- | --------- |
| `verdict` | `boolean` | Yes       |
| `data`   | `any`     | No        |

#### Here's a sample webhook response:


```JSON
{
  "verdict": true,
  "data": {
    "reason": "User passed all security checks",
    "score": 0.95,
    "additionalInfo": {
      "userStatus": "verified",
      "lastCheckTimestamp": "2024-08-21T14:30:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

<Accordion title="https://github.com/Portkey-AI/gateway/blob/main/plugins/default/webhook.ts" href="https://github.com/Portkey-AI/gateway/blob/main/plugins/default/webhook.ts" icon="github" >

```js
import { PluginContext, PluginHandler, PluginParameters } from '../types';
import { post } from '../utils';

export const handler: PluginHandler = async (
  context: PluginContext,
  parameters: PluginParameters
) => {
  let error = null;
  let verdict = false;
  let data = null;
  try {
    let url = parameters.webhookURL;
    let headers: Record<string, string=""> = parameters?.headers
      ? JSON.parse(parameters.headers)
      : {};
    ({ verdict, data } = await post(url, context, { headers }, 3000));
  } catch (e: any) {
    delete e.stack;
    error = e;
  }
  return { error, verdict, data };
};
</string,>
```
</Accordion>


Based on the verdict value, the Guardrail Check will `PASS` or `FAIL`, and will have subsequent impact on the Guardrail Actions you've set.

<Info>
  The webhook request automatically time out after **3 seconds** \-this can not be changed. So, if a webhook request times out, the Guardrail verdict will return `PASS` for that request.
