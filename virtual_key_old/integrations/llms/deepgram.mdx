description: Portkey provides a robust and secure gateway to use and observe Deepgrm's Speech-to-Text API.
---

Deepgram API is currently supported on Portkey's REST API, with support for Python & Node SDKs coming soon.

## Speech to Text API

* We set the target Deepgram API URL with the `x-portkey-custom-host` header
* We set the target provider as `openai` to let Portkey know that this request should be handled similarly to OpenAI
