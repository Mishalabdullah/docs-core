In this guide, we document how you can upgrade your current setup that uses Virtual Keys to Model Catalog Integrations.

On Portkey, there are 4 things you can do with Virtual Keys:

## 1. Create Virtual Keys --> Create AI Provider Integrations

Earlier, you created the provider integrations by going to the Virtual Keys page, selecting a provider, adding auth details, and adding any budget/rate limits if required.

Now, along with being able to create virtual keys, you can create,
1. Org-level integrations
2. Workspace-level integrations
3. New integrations that inherit their (1) keys, (2) limits, (3) model access from 1 or 2.


The first step is to create an AI Provider Integration. This is where you will store your LLM API keys and define the models you want to use.
