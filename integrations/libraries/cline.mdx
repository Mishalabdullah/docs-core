</Note>

# 1. Setting up Portkey
Portkey allows you to use 250+ LLMs with your Cline setup, with minimal configuration required. Let's set up the core components in Portkey that you'll need for integration.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Virtual Key">
Virtual Keys are Portkey's secure way to manage your LLM provider API keys. Think of them like disposable credit cards for your LLM API keys, providing essential controls like:
- Budget limits for API usage
- Rate limiting capabilities
- Secure API key storage

To create a virtual key:
Go to [Virtual Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/virtual-keys) in the Portkey App. Save and copy the virtual key ID

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/openai/virtual-key-2.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
Save your virtual key ID - you'll need it for the next step.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Create Default Config">

Configs in Portkey are JSON objects that define how your requests are routed. They help with implementing features like advanced routing, fallbacks, and retries.

We need to create a default config to route our requests to the virtual key created in Step 1.

To create your config:
1. Go to [Configs](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new config with:
    ```json
    {
        "provider":"@YOUR_PROVIDER_FROM_STEP1",
        "override_params": {
          "model": "gpt-4o" // Your preferred model name
        }
    }
    ```
3. Save and note the Config name for the next step

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/config.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
This basic config connects to your virtual key. You can add more advanced portkey features later.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Portkey API Key">

Now create Portkey API key access point and attach the config you created in Step 2:

1. Go to [API Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys) in Portkey and Create new API key
2. Select your config from `Step 2`
3. Generate and save your API key

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/api-key.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
Save your API key securely - you'll need it for Cline integration.
</Note>
</Step>
</Steps>

# 2. Integrate Portkey with Cline

Now that you have your Portkey components set up, let's connect them to Cline. Since Portkey provides OpenAI API compatibility, integration is straightforward and requires just a few configuration steps in your VS Code settings.

<Note>
You need your Portkey API Key from [Step 1](#1-setting-up-portkey) before going further.
</Note>

### Opening Cline Settings

1. Open VS Code with Cline installed
2. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command palette
3. Search for `Cline: Open in new tab`
4. Click on the settings gear icon ⚙️ in the Cline tab

### Method 1: Using Default Config (Recommended)

This method uses the default config you created in Portkey, making it easier to manage model settings centrally.

1. In the Cline settings, navigate to **API Configuration**
2. Configure the following settings:
   - **API Provider**: Select `OpenAI Compatible`
   - **Base URL**: `https://api.portkey.ai/v1`
   - **API Key**: Your Portkey API key from the setup
   - **Model ID**: `dummy` (since the model is defined in your Portkey config)

<Warning>
Using a default config with `override_params` is recommended as it allows you to manage all model settings centrally in Portkey, reducing maintenance overhead.
</Warning>

### Method 2: Using Custom Headers

If you prefer more direct control or need to use multiple providers dynamically, you can pass Portkey headers directly:

1. Configure the basic settings as in Method 1:
   - **API Provider**: `OpenAI Compatible`
   - **Base URL**: `https://api.portkey.ai/v1`
   - **API Key**: Your Portkey API key
   - **Model ID**: Your desired model (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-opus-20240229`)

2. Add custom headers by clicking "Add Header" and include:
   ```
   x-portkey-provider: YOUR_PROVIDER
   ```

   Optional headers:
   ```
   x-portkey-provider: google  // Only if not using virtual key
   x-portkey-config: YOUR_CONFIG_ID  // For additional config
   ```

<Note>
Custom headers give you flexibility but require updating headers in Cline whenever you want to change providers or models.
</Note>

You can now use Cline with all of Portkey's enterprise features enabled. Monitor your requests and usage in the [Portkey Dashboard](https://app.portkey.ai/dashboard).

# 3. Set Up Enterprise Governance for Cline

**Why Enterprise Governance?**
When deploying Cline across development teams in your organization, you need to consider several governance aspects:
- **Cost Management**: Controlling and tracking AI spending across developers
- **Access Control**: Managing which teams can use specific models
- **Usage Analytics**: Understanding how AI is being used in development workflows
- **Security & Compliance**: Protecting sensitive code and maintaining security standards
- **Reliability**: Ensuring consistent service across all developers

Portkey adds a comprehensive governance layer to address these enterprise needs. Let's implement these controls step by step.

**Enterprise Implementation Guide**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits">
### Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits

Virtual Keys enable granular control over LLM access at the team/developer level. This helps you:
- Set up [budget limits](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys/budget-limits) per developer
- Prevent unexpected usage spikes using Rate limits
- Track individual developer spending

#### Setting Up Developer-Specific Controls:
1. Navigate to [Virtual Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/virtual-keys) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new Virtual Key for each developer or team with budget limits
3. Configure appropriate limits based on seniority or project needs

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/openai/virtual-key-2.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 2: Define Model Access Rules">
### Step 2: Define Model Access Rules

As your development team scales, controlling which developers can access specific models becomes crucial. Portkey Configs provide this control layer with features like:

#### Access Control Features:
- **Model Restrictions**: Limit access to expensive models
- **Code Protection**: Implement guardrails for sensitive code
- **Reliability Controls**: Add fallbacks and retry logic

#### Example Configuration for Development Teams:
```json
{
	"strategy": {
		"mode": "fallback"
	},
	"targets": [
		{
			"provider":"@YOUR_OPENAI_PROVIDER",
			"override_params": {
				"model": "gpt-4o"
			}
		},
		{
			"provider":"@YOUR_ANTHROPIC_PROVIDER",
			"override_params": {
				"model": "claude-3-sonnet-20240229"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

Create your config on the [Configs page](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in your Portkey dashboard.

<Note>
Configs can be updated anytime to adjust controls without developers needing to update their Cline settings.
</Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 3: Implement Developer Access Controls">
### Step 3: Implement Developer Access Controls

Create Developer-specific API keys that automatically:
- Track usage per developer with metadata
- Apply appropriate configs to route requests
- Collect metadata about coding sessions
- Enforce access permissions

Create API keys through:
- [Portkey App](https://app.portkey.ai/)
- [API Key Management API](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key)

Example using Python SDK:
```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(api_key="YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY")

api_key = portkey.api_keys.create(
    name="frontend-team-developer",
    type="organisation",
    workspace_id="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID",
    defaults={
        "config_id": "your-config-id",
        "metadata": {
            "environment": "development",
            "team": "frontend",
            "developer": "john.doe"
        }
    },
    scopes=["logs.view", "configs.read"]
)
```
