**May-king it production ready✨**

In May, we shipped the kind of upgrades that help you move your AI Agents fast into productiion and stay in control — whether you're scaling, securing AI behavior, or bringing new models to your apps.

We launched deep integrations with agent frameworks like PydanticAI and OpenAI Agents SDK, added enterprise-grade controls to Claude Code, made it simpler to call a remote MCP server simpler and much more!

Here’s everything new this month:

## AI Agent Infrastructure
AI agent frameworks are helping teams prototype faster, but taking agents to production requires real infrastructure. Portkey integrates with leading frameworks to bring interoperability, observability, reliability, and cost management to your agent workflows.

**Tracing Integrations: Arize AI**

For teams consolidating observability into Arize, you can now view Portkey’s logs directly into Arize Phoenix to get unified trace views across your LLM workflows.


## Remote MCP servers

Portkey now supports calling a remote MCP server that is maintained by developers and organizations across the internet that expose these tools to MCP clients via the Responses API
Read more about the integration [here](https://portkey.ai/docs/product/ai-gateway/remote-mcp).

## Azure AI ecosystem

More than half of Fortune 500 companies use Azure OpenAI. But building GenAI apps in the enterprise is still messy, cost attribution, routing logic, usage tracking, model evaluation... all scattered.

With Portkey’s deep integration into the Azure AI ecosystem (OpenAI, Foundry, APIM, Marketplace), teams can now build, scale, and govern GenAI apps without leaving their existing cloud setup.


Our customers are vouching for it!

## Multilmodal embeddings 

Portkey now supports embedding APIs from Vertex AI for text, image, and video—across multiple languages.
This unlocks the ability to:
- Build multimodal search and retrieval
- Power multimodal RAG pipelines
- Track, route, and optimize embedding usage at scale

Read more about the implementation [here](https://portkey.ai/docs/integrations/llms/vertex-ai/embeddings)

## Platform

**Multi-label support for prompts**

<Frame>
<img width="700" src="/images/changelog/multi-label prompts.png" />
</Frame>

You can now assign multiple labels to a single prompt version, making it easy to promote a version across environments like staging and production.

**Gateway to any API**

Portkey now supports `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` HTTP methods in addition to `POST`, allowing you to route requests to any external or self-hosted provider endpoint. This means you can connect to custom APIs directly through Portkey with full observability for every call.

**OTel Integration (Analytics Data)**

You can now export Portkey analytics to any OpenTelemetry (OTel)-compatible collector, integrating easily into your existing observability stack.

**Improvements**
- Token cost tracking is now available for `gpt-image-1`.
- Ping messages are removed from streamed responses.
- Resizing metadata columns in logs

**This is what keeps us going!**

## Guardrails

- **Prompt Security guardrails**: Integrate with Prompt Security to detect prompt injection and prevent sensitive data exposure in both prompts and responses.

- **JWT validator guardrail**: Added as an input guardrail to validate incoming JWT tokens before requests are sent to the LLM.

- **PANW Prisma AIRS Plugin**: Portkey now integrates with Palo Alto Networks' AIRS (AI Runtime Security) to enforce guardrails that block risky prompts or model responses based on real-time security analysis.

- **Model whitelist guardrail**: Restrict or deny specific models at the org, environment, or request level using a flexible whitelist/blacklist guardrail.

**No frills. No hype. Just serious safety**
