## Bring Your Own Guardrail

We have built Guardrails in a very modular way, and support bringing your own Guardrail using a custom webhook! [Learn more here](/docs/product/guardrails/list-of-guardrail-checks/bring-your-own-guardrails).

The logic for all of the Guardrail Checks (including Partner Guardrails) is open source.
