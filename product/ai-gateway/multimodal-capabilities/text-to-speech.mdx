description: "Portkey's AI gateway currently supports text-to-speech models on `OpenAI` and `Azure OpenAI`."

## Usage

We follow the OpenAI signature where you can send the input text and the voice option as a part of the API request. All the output formats `mp3`, `opus`, `aac`, `flac`, and `pcm` are supported. Portkey also supports real time audio streaming for TTS models.

Here's an example:

  <Tab title="OpenAI NodeJS">

```js
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL } from 'portkey-ai'

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY",
  baseURL: PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL
});

const speechFile = path.resolve("./speech.mp3");

async function main() {
  const mp3 = await openai.audio.speech.create({
    model: "@openai/tts-1",
    voice: "alloy",
    input: "Today is a wonderful day to build something people love!",
  });
  const buffer = Buffer.from(await mp3.arrayBuffer());
  await fs.promises.writeFile(speechFile, buffer);
}

main();
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OpenAI Python">

```py
from pathlib import Path
from openai import OpenAI
from portkey_ai import PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL
)

speech_file_path = Path(__file__).parent / "speech.mp3"

response = client.audio.speech.create(
  model="@openai/tts-1",
  voice="alloy",
  input="Today is a wonderful day to build something people love!"
)

f = open(speech_file_path, "wb")
f.write(response.content)
f.close()
```
  </Tab>

 <Tab title="Python SDK">

```python
from pathlib import Path
from portkey_ai import Portkey

# Initialize the Portkey client

portkey = Portkey(
    api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",  # Replace with your Portkey API key
    provider="@PROVIDER"   
)

speech_file_path = Path(__file__).parent / "speech.mp3"

response = portkey.audio.speech.create(
  model="@openai/tts-1",
  voice="alloy",
  input="Today is a wonderful day to build something people love!"
)

f = open(speech_file_path, "wb")
f.write(response.content)
f.close()
```
    </Tab>
<Tab title="cURL">

```sh
curl "https://api.portkey.ai/v1/audio/speech" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "@openai/tts-1",
    "input": "Today is a wonderful day to build something people love!",
    "voice": "alloy"
  }' \
  --output speech.mp3
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

On completion, the request will get logged in the logs UI and show the cost and latency incurred.
