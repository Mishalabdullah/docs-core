Portkey's Enterprise Components provide the core infrastructure needed for production deployments. Each component handles a specific function - analytics, logging, or caching - with multiple implementation options to match your requirements.

## Analytics Store

Portkey leverages Clickhouse as the primary Analytics Store for the Control Panel, offering powerful capabilities for handling large-scale analytical workloads.

## Log Store

Portkey provides flexible options for storing and managing logs in your enterprise deployment. Choose from various storage solutions including MongoDB for document-based storage, AWS S3 for cloud-native object storage, or Wasabi for cost-effective cloud storage. Each option offers different benefits in terms of scalability, cost, and integration capabilities.
