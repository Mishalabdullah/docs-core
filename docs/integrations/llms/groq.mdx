Portkey provides a robust and secure gateway to facilitate the integration of various Large Language Models (LLMs) into your applications, including [Groq APIs](https://console.groq.com/docs/quickstart).

With Portkey, you can take advantage of features like fast AI gateway access, observability, prompt management, and more, all while ensuring the secure management of your LLM API keys through a [virtual key](/docs/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys) system.

## Portkey SDK Integration with Groq Models

Portkey provides a consistent API to interact with models from various providers. To integrate Groq with Portkey:

### 1\. Install the Portkey SDK

Add the Portkey SDK to your application to interact with Groq AI's API through Portkey's gateway.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS">
        ```
        npm install --save portkey-ai
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python">
        ```
        pip install portkey-ai
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>




### 2\. Initialize Portkey with the Virtual Key

To use Groq with Portkey, [get your API key from here](https://console.groq.com/keys), then add it to Portkey to create the virtual key.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">

```
import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'


const portkey = new Portkey({

    apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY", // defaults to process.env["PORTKEY_API_KEY"]

    virtualKey: "VIRTUAL_KEY" // Your Groq Virtual Key

})
```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">
        ```
        from portkey_ai import Portkey

        portkey = Portkey(

            api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",  # Replace with your Portkey API key

            virtual_key="VIRTUAL_KEY"   # Replace with your virtual key for Groq

        )
        ```

    </Tab>

  </Tabs>



### **3\. Invoke Chat Completions with** Groq

Use the Portkey instance to send requests to Groq. You can also override the virtual key directly in the API call if needed.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">

        ```
        const chatCompletion = await portkey.chat.completions.create({

            messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],

            model: 'mixtral-8x7b-32768',

        });

        console.log(chatCompletion.choices);
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">

```
completion = portkey.chat.completions.create(

    messages= [{ "role": 'user', "content": 'Say this is a test' }],

    model= 'mistral-medium'

)

print(completion)
```

    </Tab>

  </Tabs>


## Managing Groq Prompts

You can manage all prompts to Groq in the [Prompt Library](/docs/product/prompt-library). All the current models of Groq are supported and you can easily start testing different prompts.

Once you're ready with your prompt, you can use the `portkey.prompts.completions.create` interface to use the prompt in your application.

## Supported Models

| Model Name   | Model String to Use in API calls |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Llama3 8B    | llama3-8b-8192                   |
| Llama3 70B   | llama3-70b-8192                  |
| Mixtral 8x7b | mixtral-8x7b-32768               |
| Gemma 7b     | gemma-7b-it                      |
