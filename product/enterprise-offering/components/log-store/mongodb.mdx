When deploying your AI app to production, having a robust, scalable, and high-performance logging solution is crucial. That's where Portkey and MongoDB combine â€” Portkey's Enterprise version easily lets you store all your LLM logs on the most popular database services of your choice. This is made even easier with our ready-to-use Kubernetes Configs (Helm charts).

<Note>
Portkey is part of MongoDB partner ecosystem to help you build & deploy your AI apps with confidence. [Learn more](https://cloud.mongodb.com/ecosystem/portkey-ai)

#### Configuration

To use MongoDB for Log storage, you'll need to provide the following values in your `values.yaml` file for the Helm chart deployment:

```yaml
MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_URL:
MONGO_DATABASE:
MONGO_COLLECTION_NAME:
MONGO_GENERATION_HOOKS_COLLECTION_NAME:
```

#### Authentication with PEM File

If you're using a PEM file for authentication, follow these additional steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Add PEM File Details">
In the `resources-config.yaml` file, supply PEM file details under the `data` section:

```yaml
data:
  document_db.pem: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    Your certificate content here
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```
</Step>
<Step title="Modify value.yaml">
In `values.yaml`, add the following configuration:
```yaml
volumes:
- name: shared-folder
  configMap:
    name: resource-config
volumeMounts:
- name: shared-folder
  mountPath: /etc/shared/<shared_pem>
  subPath: <shared_pem>
```
</Step>
<Step title="Use the PEM File">
Update your `MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_URL` to use the PEM file:

```sh
mongodb://<user>:<password>@<host>?tls=true&tlsCAFile=/etc/shared/document_db.pem&retryWrites=false
```
</Step>
</Steps>
