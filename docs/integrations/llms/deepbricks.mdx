With Portkey, you can take advantage of features like fast AI gateway access, observability, prompt management, and more, all while ensuring the secure management of your LLM API keys through a [virtual key](/docs/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys) system.

## Portkey SDK Integration with Deepbricks Models

Portkey provides a consistent API to interact with models from various providers. To integrate Deepbricks with Portkey:

### 1. Install the Portkey SDK

Add the Portkey SDK to your application to interact with Deepbricks API through Portkey's gateway.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NodeJS">
    ```bash
    npm install --save portkey-ai
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```bash
    pip install portkey-ai
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Initialize Portkey with the Virtual Key

To use Deepbricks with Portkey, [get your API key from here](https://deepbricks.ai/pricing), then add it to Portkey to create the virtual key.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
    ```javascript
    import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'
     
    const portkey = new Portkey({
        apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY", // defaults to process.env["PORTKEY_API_KEY"]
        virtualKey: "VIRTUAL_KEY" // Your Deepbricks
    })
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python SDK">
    ```python
    from portkey_ai import Portkey
    portkey = Portkey(
        api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",  # Replace with your Portkey API key
        virtual_key="VIRTUAL_KEY"   # Replace with your virtual key for Deepbricks
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 3. Invoke Chat Completions with Deepbricks

Use the Portkey instance to send requests to Deepbricks. You can also override the virtual key directly in the API call if needed.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
    ```javascript
    const chatCompletion = await portkey.chat.completions.create({
        messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],
        model: 'deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Chat',
    });
    console.log(chatCompletion.choices);
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python SDK">
    ```python
    completion = portkey.chat.completions.create(
        messages= [{ "role": 'user', "content": 'Say this is a test' }],
        model= 'deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Chat'
    )
    print(completion)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Managing Deepbricks Prompts

You can manage all prompts to Deepbricks in the [Prompt Library](/docs/product/prompt-library). All the current models of Deepbricks are supported and you can easily start testing different prompts.

Once you're ready with your prompt, you can use the `portkey.prompts.completions.create` interface to use the prompt in your application.

The complete list of features supported in the SDK are available on the link below.
