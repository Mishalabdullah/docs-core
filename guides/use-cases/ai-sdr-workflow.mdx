# Building an AI Sales Development Representative (SDR) with Portkey

## Overview

This cookbook demonstrates how to build a sophisticated AI SDR system using Portkey's prompt templates and multiple AI models. We'll create a workflow that generates personalized outreach emails by combining the strengths of different AI models.

### Technology Stack
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Primary reasoning and email generation
- Perplexity Sonar: Real-time company research
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo: Quality assurance and compliance checking

### Expected Outcomes
- Highly personalized outreach emails
- Data-driven insights about prospect companies
- Compliance with company tone and policies
- Scalable email generation process

```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Initial Context Generation Template

```yaml
name: initial_context
model: claude-3-sonnet
template: |
  You are an expert SDR researcher. Given the following company name and context,
  generate 2-3 specific questions that would help gather relevant information for a 
  personalized outreach email.

  Company: {{company_name}}
  Context: {{context}}

  Focus on:
  - Recent company developments
  - Pain points in their industry
  - Technology stack and infrastructure

  Output Format:
  {
    "research_questions": [
      "question1",
      "question2"
    ]
  }
```

### 2. Company Research Template

```yaml
name: company_research
model: perplexity-sonar
template: |
  Research the following questions about {{company_name}}:
  {{research_questions}}

  Provide concise, factual answers based on recent information.
  
  Output Format:
  {
    "findings": {
      "question1": "answer1",
      "question2": "answer2"
    },
    "sources": ["url1", "url2"]
  }
```

### 3. Email Generation Template

```yaml
name: email_generation
model: claude-3-sonnet
template: |
  Using the research findings and company context, generate a personalized outreach email.
  
  Company: {{company_name}}
  Research Findings: {{research_findings}}
  Context: {{context}}
  
  Requirements:
  - Keep it under 150 words
  - Include specific insights from research
  - Focus on value proposition
  - End with a clear call to action
  
  Output Format:
  {
    "subject": "Subject line",
    "body": "Email body",
    "personalization_points": ["point1", "point2"]
  }
```

### 4. Quality Assurance Template

```yaml
name: quality_check
model: gpt-3.5-turbo
template: |
  Review the following email for compliance with company guidelines and effectiveness:
  
  Email: {{email_content}}
  Company Guidelines: {{guidelines}}
  Tone Requirements: {{tone_requirements}}
  
  Check for:
  - Compliance with guidelines
  - Appropriate tone
  - Grammar and clarity
  - Personalization effectiveness
  
  Output Format:
  {
    "passes_guidelines": boolean,
    "suggested_changes": ["change1", "change2"],
    "tone_score": 1-10,
    "personalization_score": 1-10
  }
```

## Scaling with Portkey

### Batch Processing
```python
from portkey import Template, Workflow

workflow = Workflow([
    Template("initial_context"),
    Template("company_research"),
    Template("email_generation"),
    Template("quality_check")
])

# Process multiple companies
results = workflow.batch_process(companies_list)
```

### Monitoring and Analytics
- Use Portkey's built-in analytics to track:
  - Model performance
  - Cost per email
  - Success rates
