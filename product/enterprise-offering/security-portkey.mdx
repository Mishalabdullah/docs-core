This document outlines our robust security protocols, designed to meet the needs of businesses requiring high standards of data protection and operational reliability.

At Portkey AI, we understand the critical importance of security in today's digital landscape and are committed to delivering state-of-the-art solutions that protect our clients' data and ensure their AI applications run smoothly.

## Security Framework

### Authentication

Portkey AI ensures secure API access through token-based authentication mechanisms, supporting Single Sign-On (SSO) via OIDC on enterprise plans.

We also implement [Virtual Keys](/docs/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys), which provide an added layer of security by securely storing provider API keys within a controlled and monitored environment.

This multi-tier authentication strategy is crucial for protecting against unauthorized access and ensuring the integrity of user interactions.

### Encryption

To protect data integrity and privacy, all data in transit to and from Portkey AI is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher. We employ AES-256 encryption for data at rest, safeguarding it against unauthorized access and breaches.

These encryption standards are part of our commitment to maintaining secure data channels and storage.

### Access Control

Our access control measures are designed with granularity to offer precise control over who can see and manage data.

For enterprise clients, we provide enhanced [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/docs/product/enterprise-offering/access-control-management#id-2.-fine-grained-user-roles-and-permissions), allowing for stringent governance suited to complex organizational needs.

This system is pivotal for enforcing security policies and ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive operations and data.

## Compliance and Data Privacy

### Compliance with Standards

Our platform is compliant with leading security standards, including [SOC2, ISO27001, GDPR, and HIPAA](https://trust.portkey.ai).

Portkey AI undergoes regular audits, compliance checks, and penetration testing conducted by third-party security experts to ensure continuous adherence to these standards.

These certifications demonstrate our commitment to global security practices and our ability to meet diverse regulatory requirements.
